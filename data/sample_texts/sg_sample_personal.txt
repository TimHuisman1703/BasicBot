I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friend‚Äôs house, so you text this: [ see you soon üôÇ ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon üòâ ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can‚Äôt see anything else than him, so you can‚Äôt try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he‚Äôs racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you‚Äôve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. ‚Äúcan i have some French fries?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why there called French fries when I‚Äôve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and cr√™pes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} ‚ÄúHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh‚Ä¶.. heeeheehe.. hehe‚Ä¶ sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ‚Äù (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesn‚Äôt really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn‚Äôt have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can‚Äôt get internet anyway (it‚Äôs actually a really funny story that i‚Äôll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don‚Äôt ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say ‚Äúwin a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*‚Äù(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: ‚Äúone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we don‚Äôt want to get sued so we did this promotion thing‚Äù cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that‚Äôs pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don‚Äôt) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will‚Ä¶ drum roll please ‚Ä¶ badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepy‚Ä¶ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didn‚Äôt know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down üò¶) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got to‚Ä¶ are you ready ‚Ä¶ arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different thicknesses. isn‚Äôt that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow ‚Äúfarm plastics collection‚Äù semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i can‚Äôt tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then you‚Ä¶ get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i don‚Äôt understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say ‚Äúwow! that looks great!‚Äù and you think {bubble thing} ‚Äúit looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eat‚Äù and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly‚Ä¶ WORSE than you imagined! gotta go‚Ä¶ im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinking‚Ä¶ HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer is‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt. that‚Äôs right. this isn‚Äôt just some SIDE project. i‚Äôve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i don‚Äôt know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because i‚Äôm jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) I‚ÄôVE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY! THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? he‚Äôs not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering i‚Äôm the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, aren‚Äôt eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldn‚Äôt it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae wit‚Äô da guv‚Äôna (england doesn‚Äôt even have a govna! *citation needed*)(i‚Äôm not even racist i‚Äôm just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming ‚ÄúMAMA! MAMA!‚Äù you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! i‚Äôm sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And Coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)} i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but it‚Äôs ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. i‚Äôm back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write ‚Äúneed help‚Äù? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, ‚Äòblack surfboards‚Äô? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL. HeRe GoEs: The Epicness ‚Äì Hi how are you? Smells good ya! Think about that buddy (shower time) heheheheHAHAHA well thanks a lot so called buddy. Random things: joe be utterly hatin.

I‚Äôm back! and i gotta new conspiracy for u! you know how EVERY child hates brussels sprouts! this is why i think so. Brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home. everyone loved them! they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world. when suddenly‚Ä¶ DA DADA DA! Hitler comes to Belgium (dont read this if you don‚Äôt want to. hitler was happily taking over Austria and Poland when he then decided to take over France but France built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and Germany so all Hitler did was go through Belgium to get to France and THAT is when our story is taking place.) and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them! the Mulligan family is about to go to McRonalds and order 43 brussels sprouts (you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke) and when they get them (after lots of quarrels with the manager (a bit of a parker square if you ask me (you probably don‚Äôt understand that either(if you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes, just look em up on the web! your sure to find the videos made by lumberpile(close enough))))) they taste so bad you throw up everywhere! Hitler may have caused WWII, but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad. so there you go. why do they always write WWII? (if you can‚Äôt tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to write WW11 or WW2? If i keep writing at this rate, i‚Äôll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably don‚Äôt have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole ‚Äòno hospitals‚Äô conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout Minecraft? just in case you don‚Äôt know, Minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but I not and i still have fun and you can‚Äôt judge me because I wanna be an engineer and if I wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. Anyway, I prefer the Redstone side of things (Redstone means wiring and stuff). I build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you don‚Äôt know people, command blocks are like CHEATING THINGS and if I am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. I also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! My current BIGGEST project is 600 lines long and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a lot but it sure seems like it to me! (when I was typing in the word lines it auto corrected it to ‚Äòlies‚Äô) what‚Äôs with the whole naming appliances fad going on? (There isn‚Äôt really one) like that vacuum named ‚ÄòHenry‚Äô that I have. I have the box here and it says on it it can twist the top part which I never knew before! I just woke up but the anticipation of whether this whole Henry twist bit this is true is killing me and I think I might wake up just to see if its true. Nahhhhhhhhhhh! This text is getting so long it‚Äôs getting laggy just typing on the same notes on my phone! I gotta start a new one.

I don‚Äôt even remember typing that! It‚Äôs so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone! Now, I know what your thinking. TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS, KING OF RAINBOWFLUFFYSHEEP! I will tell you why I shall not. Because on an iPhone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness. That‚Äôs for the WIMP. I‚Äôm hardcore. That‚Äôs why I Have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read, in the comfort of your own home! (Or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. Click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. Swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. Type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. Click on the Settings App (Your Almost There!) 5. Click on the ‚ÄòBrightness/Wallpaper‚Äô Tab. 6. GOOD JOB! ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SWIPE THE LITTLE BAR THINGY! that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt have THAT much time. I think. Halloo! I‚Äôm in London and I‚Äôm hangin out! Now I‚Äôm back though. This is extremely frightening. Whenever I type words then my phone reads it out to me. Strange. I just turned it off. Good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. Not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. Once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. One thing I have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. Here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks Laughing hysterically*)) STATES that the shearer of greatness (who‚Äôs that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, an‚Äô fer unitee. Ye still the states Connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. And now gentlemen and ladies, I will prove once and for all that the illuminati ‚Ä¶ Is real. Here goes: So, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. Do you think that it is merely a COINCIDENCE that the first letter in illuminati is i, and I is pronounced ‚Äòeye‚Äô? I THINK NOT! Let‚Äôs continue. What is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? Exactly! The first thing you think of is Egypt? Nooooo!! It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre big. Duh. So what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? ‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs big?‚Äù No of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! You would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like ‚ÄúOooooh‚Äù and ‚ÄúAhhhhhhh‚Äù. And I know how these two things are connected! What temperature would it be in Egypt? Hot, that‚Äôs what! So hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. Ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! And what county sounds like apan? Japan? Now is it just a COINCIDENCE that that Japanese word for big is ‚ÄòOo‚Äô? NOOO!!! These things are all connected, I just don‚Äôt fully know how yet. So, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. I call this method, Reverse Solvency. Anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) Egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? Exactly! They sold em‚Äô that sounds like soldier! In French that‚Äôs gendarme! Gender! That‚Äôs what they are trying to tell us! It‚Äôs so obvious, in front of our very EYEs from the beginning! So, what gender is associated with being big! (This is gonna be slightly offensive) Males, obviously! (I‚Äôm sorry üò¶ *audience member calls out* don‚Äôt be sexist! Sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! ‚ÄúHey, now you‚Äôre being sexist to males! We have our rights, you know!!! Chauvinists! Communists! We are great! Who insists? Communists! We will rule with hate!!! ‚Äù ummm actually I was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the PYRAMIDS if you were fat you were considered wealthy. ‚ÄúNow your sexist to us again! Feminists rule! Feminists are great! We are going to rule with hate!!‚Äù If you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! Thank you. Anyway, back to the conspiracy) Where were we? Oh yes. Men! What word has men in it? Fishermen, of course! Fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the Egyptians have a lot of? Gods! Fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with ‚Äòod‚Äô. And where are the fishermen!?!? In the sea! The ‚Äòc‚Äô! And what kind of fish do they catch? That‚Äôs right, the ‚ÄòCod‚Äô! Now, we use are backwards method to come up with ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô. As in a doctor! What does a doctor do? Helps people who are sick! But do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? You still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! And mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! Alas, This is as far as I have gotten. Can anyone help me? Um yes, you? ‚ÄúYes, I was just wondering what Big, men , ooo, not bees, Bills , and sickness have to so with the Illuminati! ‚Äù wait anonymous audience member say that again! ‚ÄúBut like, it was a lot of words‚Äù [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the Maine character says aha! I think I got it!] ‚Äúgot what? The flu?‚Äù Who the heck are you? And how did you get backstage? Security?!?! SECURITY!!!!! ‚Äúyes sir?‚Äù What are you guys wearing?! ‚ÄúObviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!‚Äù Now I don‚Äôt even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! Annnyyywwwaaayyy‚Ä¶ I figured it out! Bill, no bee and sick! No bee is actually no ‚ÄòB‚Äô, the letter! The only b we have is in bill! And if you take it off, what do you get. ‚Äúill‚Äù . And what is a synonym for ill. Sick. We have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. What did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? They were eating, of course! And what were the poor doing in their spare time? What any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? Playing Sports, of course? And where are the rich buried? In coffins like boxes. When someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line x‚Äôs in italics. Huh; box, x. An XBox of course! And what company makes sports for an Xbox? Electronic arts. We‚Äôve all heard of ‚ÄòE A Sports. It‚Äôs In The Game.‚Äô. if the rich are ‚Äòeat‚Äô and the poor are ‚Äòea‚Äô the only letter not used in both is the letter T! As in tea! A tea is going to come in handy. Even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! It‚Äôs all starting to make sense to me now! It‚Äôs all fitting together like the pieces of child‚Äôs jigsaw! Remember the plagues on Egypt? One of those must be a clue, but which one!? For this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. What number do they have in common? 3, of course! A triangle has three sides! If you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them ‚Äò3‚Äô, then chances are they would draw a triangle! It even has three in its name ‚Äì tri-angle! And how many color cones does an eye have? You guessed it, three. And the third plague is: let‚Äôs see here‚Ä¶ Gnats. What has a gnat got to do with anything? That information is probably gnat even right (LOLZ)! Anyway, let‚Äôs keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. Who was the last pharaoh in Egypt? Cleopatra. She‚Äôs so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! The movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. So old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. Remember the fishermen from before! They connect! The ‚Äòreels‚Äô! I think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. Lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. What happens if we squish them all together. Illoomenateaisgnatreel. Illoomenatea is gnat reel. Oh. Well, good thing we got that cleared up. Guess what peeps? I have made it to 35000 characters! Why is that so significant, you might ask? Because the world record is 35000 words! That means that all I have to do is replace every letter with a word. Like this: instead of writing ‚ÄòI‚Äôm back!‚Äô I could say ‚Äòinternet mascara beagle Australia catamaran kipper‚Äô and all you do is read the first letter! This would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least i‚Äôll beat the record! Also I have another Up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! Instead of just writing a normal sentence I replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! Yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! So here goes: ‚Äòjumping cacti ate many jars containing marmalade‚Äô -> ‚Äòany of numerous succulent plants of the family Cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the New World, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.‚Äô Wow, that took longer than I expected. Just so I don‚Äôt get sued, I am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary. com. And now, a word from our sponsor. *Kshhhhhhh* Have you ever been sick before? Then this pill is for you! We have a 100% guarantee that you will never get sick again!

Kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. I need a topic. Not just any topic that you find on the floor, but a topic so magnifico, so delisimo, and so interestinio, that I that I fall on the ground in a seizure. I got one! This is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! I will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! My apprentice, you have trained hard. There is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. All hail the ninjapeeps! (You don‚Äôt actually have to) who said that?! Who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! I did. And you are? The Writer. Nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but that‚Äôs sensei to you. Howdy pawtna! No, we are actually japanese, not texan. Kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! Sensei, don‚Äôt respond! Don‚Äôt you remember what this man did? No. He was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! Oh yes, that‚Äôs right. Sorry dude, but PREPARE TO BE THROWN INTO THE SIXTH DIMENSION, YOU DIRTY RASCAL! The sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at The Writer. It hit him and pushed him into the board! Do it! The Apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. Not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, reader. Don‚Äôt ‚ÄòThey‚Äô always say to make a story believable!? And to that I say‚Ä¶ but it is. You see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! You! No insults or we‚Äôre going to have to stop this little ‚Äòplay‚Äô of yours!) ok‚Ä¶ whatever. You probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? WELL YOU‚ÄôD BE WRONG! Actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. Here‚Äôs an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. When it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. You will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! Isn‚Äôt that fabulous? That means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) The Writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. Little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (It actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. If you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. Also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what The Writer did next was simple! He simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the sensei‚Ä¶ This is making less sense as we go. In the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe. exe has stopped responding. Noooooooooooooooo ‚Äî Yep. And that is what I do with my life essentially. Gotta go now sea ya! I‚Äôm back! With a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! Zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! When choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. I‚Äôm not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even HAVE zooreka). Now that I think About it, that wasn‚Äôt really a conspiracy, was it :(. I have a reward for you reader. If you have truly made it this far than‚Ä¶ Give me your email and I will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! Send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail. com, inquiring. Also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! In section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it CLEARLY STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (that‚Äôs me!) will reply to ANY email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail. com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). Hey! I just realised that when I wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! What a sham! ShamWOW! In section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! Hurrah! Hurrah! Three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (But that was only two, Harold. Whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way Color was born. THE END. I‚Äôm back! And do I have an exciting subject for you! No! I don‚Äôt! Ha, gotcha there, didn‚Äôt I! Wow, it just started raining. Oh wait, it‚Äôs snow! Not just any snow, mind you, but it‚Äôs topicsnow! Yay! All these great topics falling softly from the sky. What could be better. I‚Äôm now walking down the street. Hey you! Ye? Is that a topicman? Yes sir, tis! Well ain‚Äôt that great. If want to get the best topics, I must climb mt. Big. Hey look, there‚Äôs some kids having a topicball fight! How fun. Noooooo! A topicalanche! (That doesn‚Äôt even make sense!!! The word avalanche doesn‚Äôt even have the world snow in it!) Since I died, i didn‚Äôt get any topics. Sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90‚Äôs pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. Forget‚Ä¶ Forget‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. You drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. Beside is the corpse of‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ an onion?!?! Wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. I just read what I wrote and it makes less sense than I thought. Little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. I didn‚Äôt even know that. You know that guy from shamWOW! He always said all these great things about that weird sponge? Yea, that was a short topic. Im gone. Im back! Wait, how did i type if i was gone? With my mmmiiiinnnnddddd‚Ä¶ woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! Anyway, this is what i was thinking. I feel really sorry for water molecules! All they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! Wahoo! Or, so you think. In reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! They drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! They take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! They teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! Like ‚Äòevaporation‚Äô, more like flying up to the sky knowing that it‚Äôs your final moment ‚Äì ation! Condensation!?!? More like con ‚Äì ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! How could you be so ‚Äì dense ‚Äì ation! (Public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakin‚Äô: *where is he? Dunno.* this was test, and only a test. Had this been a real public service announcement then i would have ‚Äì not been here! Harharhar ! Stop making fun of harold! He was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to ‚Äì its OK bob, i don‚Äôt care about the Larry squad. They don‚Äôt bother me no longer. KK harold‚Ä¶.. umm‚Ä¶ this was a te ‚Äì wait, did we already do that part? Uh, ya i think so‚Ä¶. so this is awkward. Ya, sooooooo ‚Äì *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! What the heck do i pay you for? To‚Ä¶ get‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ coffee, sir. Oh, you the coffee boy? Why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? I almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! I was told not to put in in, sir. By who? Lets just say i got a‚Ä¶ Higher Calling. You‚Ä¶ you m-m-mean that The Boss called? Yes, budget cuts he said. No more cream he said. No more name-brand cereal! Nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! Is this‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt. Oh, try me. Yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. Why was i here again? Oh ya‚Ä¶ CUT TO A COMMERCIAL ALREADY! We don‚Äôt have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. Well obviously the public didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ di- it all makes sense now! The budget cut is BECAUSE of us not playing enough commercials! But sir, our quota ends tomorrow! We need to have played 50837 commercials! There is. Only. One. Way. Play all the commercials at 100x speed! Is that even LeGaL?! Of course it is! We might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. Don‚Äôt people get epilepsy from watching fast images? This is a radio station, so people can just hear it! Ummm‚Ä¶ this is an earlepsy warning! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHhahahahhahha hehe he‚Ä¶ heh. That wasn‚Äôt funny, steven.) And back to our regular program. I just started a sentence with a preposition! Isn‚Äôt that, like, seven years bad luck or something? Well I can solve that. Section 1 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some LOSERS would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (What the hooey is a preponderance? It says here that it means to be greater than something. Well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! Mwahahaahaha!) Now i can start with a preposition too. Well that worked. (The reason that I used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. You see, 1 isn‚Äôt considered a prime number! Like what the hey! Its only factors are one and itself!) Do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? And the 777 of the particle world is getting‚Ä¶ Hmmmm. I actually have now idea. Maybe just hydrogen! Hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. But then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. A typical particle would be at one. Here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the Rolling Stones. I can‚Äôt believe it has come to this. I force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. It‚Äôs lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jack‚Äìin‚Äìthe‚Äìbox (the reason i did that is because I was putting a space between every word, AND jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. I clenched the red metal ball with all my might. It was cold as Alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. I jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. It came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. I refocused my attention to the screen. The cylinders were rolling faster than A grands prix racers tyre. Suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. I stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. H. It said H. I should have been happy, I know, but I wasn‚Äôt completely out of the woods yet. There was a tiny times two symbol beside it. I didn‚Äôt care. I pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. It spinning thing that doesn‚Äôt have a name stopped. O. No. It was the letter O! Now I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe? Because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. ENOUGH WITH THE WATER PARTICLES!! I have a conspiracy theory! You know those spinny poles that barbers have? Of course you do! They are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subSPINinalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. There is a haircut called ‚Äúmeet me at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù that is BANNED where I live. goodbye. and remember‚Ä¶ barbers are eevviill! I‚Äôm back! Did you know that palm trees aren‚Äôt actually trees? Yea, that‚Äôs right, palm TREES!!! I think that they‚Äôre bushes or something. That makes me angry! in section 6.02214129√ó10^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (Horton hears a who). On a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now it‚Äôs like the size of a truck. I was listening to this amazing radio station and this is ACTUALLY what it was about. I will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. ‚ÄúRecently, a Russian double-agent was poisoned in England. Also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didn‚Äôt get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. he‚Äôs a great lad, he is, he‚Äôs had a great life. By the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! Go over to her house and say hello! I have her post code written on the back of my phone. Also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.‚Äù I know what you‚Äôre thinking: there‚Äôs no way this actually happened, right? YES THIS WAS REAL! And I thought it was pretty funny hehehe. I need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. So today I was in the library, minding my own business, when I noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (I‚Äôm guessing from ages 2-5). Classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so I was already skeptical. He was drawing a zombie. ‚ÄúAnd now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (Wait what? Lets try this again) And now you see, the zombies chinos like a‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ A line.‚Äù‚Äùwhy does the zombie look like its from the Simpsons?‚Äù‚Äùbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.‚Äù‚ÄùI‚Äôve seen that movie!‚Äù‚Äùyeah me too!!‚Äù‚Äùumm.. Ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?‚Äù*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason I thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. What‚Äôs up with the saying, ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô? Like what the hooey! Pie is really hard to make. The pie crust always ends up being soggy.‚Äôpiece of cake‚Äô is a saying too! What‚Äôs with all these people that think baking is easy! (Now that I think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). Maybe I just need to calm down. NOOOO!!! In section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (that‚Äôs me!) hereby declares that the sayings ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of cake‚Äô are now changed to ‚Äòeasy as bread‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of bread‚Äô. I just realised that I was typing with my phone in portrait mode! Now I turned it into landscape and I feel so freeeeeee!!! I need to come up with other things that I do randomly‚Ä¶ Like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! If I am talking about some random subject, I will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesn‚Äôt exist) to do! Piece of bread! In section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it STATES that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (They probably won‚Äôt do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that I don‚Äôt have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. From now on, it is considered TRFSHCBS. I probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. And take out ‚Äòthe‚Äô. RAFLUSHEHACHABOOS. Pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. that‚Äôll work. I need to write more to fill my writer quota. That just sounded cool to say. I probably write about‚Ä¶ 100 words a day. Well I started today at the zombie thing, so yea. What‚Äôs going to be the next big thing in the future? Technically, I‚Äôm writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail. com and tell me what the future‚Äôs like! The only problem is that I will only receive it in the future. Another one of my BRILLIANT ideas gone down the tubes. Goodbye. The world is unjust! I worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. And then they announced‚Ä¶ We made it to the country finals! The COUNTRY! By that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! It was amazing. But we came in second. Guess what the prize was for second?!?! TAKE A WILD GUESS!!!! NOTHING! This wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. And GUESS WHO GOT SAID FREE STUFF?!?! MY BROTHER, THAT‚ÄôS WHO!!! So in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. The world is unjust! Unfair! Prejudiced! Biased! Fascist! (Wait, that was autocorrected). I just needed to get my anger out. When I wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! That‚Äôs the last time i buy an apple product. How many devices companies are fruit? There‚Äôs apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (I‚Äôve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). That could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! What would you like to order, moisuer? I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Oui, oui. Harold! That costs $5k! So? I bet it‚Äôs good! KSHHH and here‚Äôs how the skit would have went if I had autocorrect on. Why would you like to order, moisture? You guys have moisture in this restaurant? that‚Äôs not up to the code for restaurants. i‚Äôll have to tell the building inspector! Oh yes, anyway, I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Out, out! Runnnn! I‚Äôm coming Harold! That waiter must have something about fruit salad! Maybe he had a bad experience as a child. Wow, I sure went off on a tangent. Do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! The iPad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. And the iPhone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? A phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (That was a bit far fetched) and the MacBook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the inside‚Ä¶ Cuz laptops are like two parts‚Ä¶ You know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought you‚Äôd like to know that)) Earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! And they‚Äôd call the charger ‚ÄòThe Root‚Äô. Why a great idea! I will let apple use these names and I only need a 0.00000000000001% share In the company. Even though I did work hard at this. I just thought of something amazing! If you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. TWO BUCKS!!! You know for a FACT that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. The shop is five minutes away. If you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (Except in the case that you have to walk back. If so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option(or just get salsa. It‚Äôs on sale! (Which probably means that its old))) wasn‚Äôt that interesting? Here‚Äôs another situation. You are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now I‚Äôd say) and you think ‚Äúwhat a steal!‚Äù And your neighbour thinks ‚Äúwhere did i put that shotgun cartridge again? But is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (Assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) That‚Äôs 32 YEARS! Let‚Äôs say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, that‚Äôs still 238 weeks! That‚Äôs still five years! Just buy a camper van for goodness sake! I just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (Assuming people still bought the same amount (I think I can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. Which means instead of selling these cornflakes: Box height: 1 meter; Box length: 1 meter; Box width: 1 meter; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake (not air): 100%; Percent of box filled with bag: 100%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; Production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: Box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake (not air): 90%; Percent of box filled with bag: 90%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; Production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! Hooray! Well that‚Äôs that. You know how people always have weird names on the interweb? Well I came up with Internet name generator! (Random adjective)(Random noun)(Use a deck of cards for this part. Take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. Pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. If it is three or lower, put X at the start and end)(pick a card. If it is an ace, replace noun with random country. If it is a two, replace noun with Internet related company + fan.) let me try this. Here is what I got: FoulSoup31, XxInternalAle10xX, StrengthenedFillet49458, MediocreElectrode20, and EpicRedditFan7515. That was a lot more accurate than I thought it would be. Bye. Hello! I need to rant more! I am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. I wish I could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. That was fun. Why is orange so popular? There are SO MANY WORDS that don‚Äôt rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isn‚Äôt a real word as far as I know). And people know that orange rhymes with ‚Äúdoor hinge‚Äù! Some people say that doesn‚Äôt count. But there is another! Sporangia! Well, it‚Äôs pretty close. I think it‚Äôs like fern spores. Well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. For Halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. Trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. Oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (The soon to be fruit). The sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. I have a map of Europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. BEWARE IF YOU LIVE IN: The UK, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Denmark and Armenia. You guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. And my favourite pop is club orange! Nooooo! And Jupiter will disappear too! Now that I think about it, losing orange things wouldn‚Äôt be that bad compared to other colors. Like blue. We would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the Rust comic book series, the sky, Pluto and that one triple angry bird. That would be awful. In section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. Now you guys don‚Äôt have to worry! :)! Why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? That‚Äôs really sexist! People think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (If you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm mocking that people that get offended by everything). Why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? Plants have feelings too (I think)! In fact, vegetarians kill MORE than carnivores. Instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! Think about THAT, people! In this whole LoTeEv, I have probably offended a lot of you guys. Sorry bout that. In section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the RFSH*. Why are the money symbols not consistent? Like there‚Äôs ‚Ç¨uros, ¬•en and ¬£ounds. But why $ollars? Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to be dollar$. That makes more sense. Now I won‚Äôt get that nervous eye twitch every time I see that symbol. ‚ÄúHey look, I just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! Hey why the flop is he doing that?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a Thing that he does‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have a great idea for this! Whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! That means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!‚Äù And that‚Äôs how I lost all my friends. It turns out that was the only reason they liked me. Wait what is this ?? That is so ?eird. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! Hahahaha gotcha! I was just kidding about that. But you would have never known that! I‚Äôm going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. Hmmmm‚Ä¶ Lets see. Tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. Fascinating. I‚Äôm going to make a fake movie trailer. Using only words. Here we go: [Have you ever‚Ä¶]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted to‚Ä¶]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[This is a great movie, if you are an IDIOT][‚Äúthis is a great movie‚Äù][i had popcorn while I watched this movie, and I really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][‚ÄúI really enjoyed it, it really soothed‚Äù][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][wait‚Ä¶ What? You know we‚Äôre not paying you guys right? Oh. Anyway, ‚ÄúI actually really enjoyed the movie!‚Äù][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{well‚Ä¶ No, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[Coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][The Lard of the Rigs] That was actually fun! {Warning: if you use this movie name you will BE SUED actually now that I think about it you probably won‚Äôt. In fact, if you DO actually make this into a movie, send it to me} Do you guys think I‚Äôm random enough? I really hope so! In section 5647382910 of the RAFLUSHE ‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember. That challengey things name. But anyway, make that movie. Plz. I‚Äôm board. And not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the White House. By!!! I‚Äôm back! No, just kidding, I‚Äôm front! I have a topic that I‚Äôm actually very serious about. Puzzles. Am I the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! That‚Äôs like the PROOF that the human race have made it too far. When we actually make challenges that we have to face OURSELVES, AND WE PAY FOR THEM! We are literally paying to give ourselves problems! We have enough problems! Well at least I do ;). Probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! I‚Äôm going to type something about politics to sound super cool. As you know, recently president Obama (That was like years ago) oh‚Ä¶ Sozsozsoz. As you know, recently president Nixon (no, that‚Äôs not exactly right) Oh yea, I forgot. As you know, recently president Lincoln (ARGH! We are not doing this anymore) was a president before Donald (finally) Duck! (Nooooo! It‚Äôs TRUMP) What? No! You think you‚Äôre SOOO smart person who talks in the brackets. Actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says YOU‚ÄôRE FIRED!!! What, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says ‚ÄúGEAT TOUW THAE CHAEOPPAER‚Äù is a governor too!?! Hahahaha‚Ä¶ Donald Duck was a great president. His slogan was ‚ÄúI will fight for american democrats‚Äù and he bathes in gold. What a great job. Money is so dirty though! Now that I think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. Or else, how could he afford it?! I have a new segment in my text now! It‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúRandom Fun Fact‚Äù segment! (Now that I think about it, I never know when to use those ‚Äú. I think it‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äù when someone is talking and ‚Äù for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. For example: ‚ÄúHello there Chuckie! How‚Äôya doing ‚Äònice guy‚Äô. Were you being sarcastic? Yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when I‚Äôm talking to you?‚Ä¶ Science.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how they work) where was I? Random fax! I will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! How brilliant! The facts of the paragraph are‚Ä¶ Ice cream was invented in china, something that is ‚Äòblue‚Äô (got it right there!) Is actually every color BUT blue, and I like cheese. And the country of the paragraph is‚Ä¶ Mexico! Why not, right? Did you ever wonder how records work? (Just in case you don‚Äôt know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) I know how they WORK, with ridges and diaphragms and blah Blah BLah BLAh BLAH‚Ä¶ But how do they WORK?!?! Like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet Pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and that‚Äôs when I checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) And then they realise‚Ä¶ Hey! Bumpy things can make sounds! I just can‚Äôt get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). Do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? I currently collect words, pins and the ‚Äúto kill a mockingbird‚Äù series (not much work (besides the fact that I have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning (the last time I will ever bring a library book late again is when I borrowed the book entitled ‚ÄòHow to sharpen a pencil for dummies‚Äô (Don‚Äôt blame me! It was the ‚ÄòExtended and revised‚Äô edition! They had all the technical ‚Äòlead vs. graphite‚Äô stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or I would be fired (yes, I worked at the library (I never could figure out the Dewey decimal system)). Now that I think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. Oh no, I never handed in the ‚Äòhow to sharpen a pen for dummies‚Äô book! (Which I rate a 3/5, ‚Äúwould not borrow again‚Äù because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do YOU have reader? Find out next time on ‚Äúdeer or no deer!‚Äù (Remember forehead sweets) oh no! I wrote how to kill a mocking bird! I meant ‚Äòpow do gill hamma (hammer) king turd‚Äô. Phew. Got outta that one. I have a new topic! A high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! I figured out a great business plan! Make onsies! Not just out of clothes, but out of everything! Like: Did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? Well ONSIE! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? Well ONSIE! [handshakes himself] Do you have twins? Well ONSIE! [wait‚Ä¶ How is this supposed to work?] Get yours now at your local Amazon (which might not be very accessible if you don‚Äôt live in South America) for a free trial! *happy tune* Onsie, Onesie! Life is better with a onsie. Spin a web, less than two. ONSIE! (I think that was to the tune of Spider-Man (I mean Smiter-Can) Onsies only cost‚Ä¶ Whatever you want them to cost! Yeah, I think i‚Äôm going to go now. Baiii! Wait.. What? When did i wrote that ONSIE thing?? I just came back and I do not remember doing that. What the hat does ‚ÄòSpin a web, less than two‚Äù even mean? That is some weird stuff. So today I listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. He was talking about these married people in Germany that are going to a Walking Dead convention for their 17th anniversary. Weird. Weird, weird, WEIRD!!! You know guitar tuna? Probably not. It is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). I thought of how they could make so much more money! If they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE THE SAME THING!!! They would make so much money! Wait. What about canned tuna! (Also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). Well, that‚Äôs my stuff for today! Hallo! I‚Äôm back! And I don‚Äôt get house decorations nowadays. People put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! People always talk about that ‚ÄòVintage Look‚Äô which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said ‚Äúwhy do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your HOUSE?!?!‚Äù In their house. I should rant. Like what I‚Äôm doing now. I‚Äôm just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. I should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . Actually, since it only matters for words count, I should just type really small words. Hi, my name is jo. (Its not actually, but I need to type small words). I eat a lot of pie and I love it too. It is yum in my tum. Wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). Hello there, reader! I‚Äôve just decided that I want to talk to you. I always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe I should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. Oh I see what‚Äôs happening. Either you can‚Äôt talk to me because you are in the future and I‚Äôm in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, or‚Ä¶ Your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! I could never figure out those things either. They‚Äôre so confusing. Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh, there it is! The ‚Äòwalkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge YOU will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? If you are ever playing, always buy America, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time I played (are you saying that games are DIFFERENT every time you play them!?!? (That‚Äôs the last time I mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very own‚Ä¶ WALKIE-TALKIE! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets see‚Ä¶ Contents‚Ä¶ It says the contents page is on page 1‚Ä¶ Wait ‚Äì WHAT?!?! The contents page has a line for the contents page! That‚Äôs like a website having a link to itself! (Which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like I could a a tab on my website called ‚Äúthe best sites on the web! And I would have links to places like YouTube and twitter (or whatever you young‚Äôuns go to these days! When I was a lad I used to play ‚ÄòPok√©mon Pearl‚Äô and ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô now you kids are all on her newfangled ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go get outta here‚Äô and yer ‚ÄòSnapperChatters‚Äô (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you won‚Äôt know that I was talking about Pokemon go and snapchat (or how I got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (Now that in think about it, I started reading the longest text ever by ‚ÄòSam‚Äô (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! And I don get the references to stuff like ‚Äòneopets‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Matrix‚Äô))))))) Okay where is it‚Ä¶ Oh there; it says that the ‚Äòpretty much how to use it‚Äô section is on page -3! Well thats eas- how do I go to page -3! Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh look! They have a ‚Äòhow to go to negative pages section too! It‚Äôs on page -7. Noooo!! I guess I‚Äôll just look it up on the Internet. Ok first you have to turn the book into antimatter‚Ä¶ Ok got that done‚Ä¶ Now just turn to the page without the negative! Well that was easy. I‚Äôm on page 7 now. It says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! I‚Äôll go to page three now. It says here, and I quote: ‚Äúto use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkie‚Äù. Did you that reader! Can you try talking to me now? Oh yes! I can hear you! Oh wait, I‚Äôm on the wrong station. I‚Äôm on number five, but your on number six. I have to click a button to change my station number! Too much work. Do you think I‚Äôm crazy because I talk to myself? I‚Äôm not! Yes you are. I am not! Isn‚Äôt talking to yourself the DEFINITION of crazy? I‚Äôm not talking to myself. The who do you think I am? Oh yea. I‚Äôm your imaginary friend, RatGuy! Don‚Äôt you remember me! No. Oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- I CAN‚ÄôT TALK TO YOU WHEN YOUR CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING YOURSELF! Technically, since you‚Äôre talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. I guess I am. Continue, RatGuy. As I was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. We would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only DREAMED of, like the ‚Äòground ollie‚Äô and the ‚Äòdown-the-curb‚Äô. We moved at speeds that the other kids couldn‚Äôt even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. But RatGuy? Yes? If sewers moving at 90%!‚Ä¢ the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball. This is a story, Writer. Stories don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòwork‚Äô. I NEED TO STOP!!! I keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and I can‚Äôt stop. Are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what I‚Äôve just been typing to the last hour!?!? Oh wait, you can‚Äôt tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isn‚Äôt on the same channel as mine. I just realised something. I work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants. And how do people repay me? By writing more than me!!! I spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then I type it all up! And then I see that people want quantity, not quality! But no! You loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because I‚Äôm thinking of things and stuff. I was just thinking, I need complain about my life more. That‚Äôs what all the people are doing nowadays. ‚ÄúOh, my life is so hard, I just broke a fingernail!‚Äù BIG DEAL! ‚ÄúOh, my life is hard too, i just broke a finger‚Äù BUG REAL! ‚Äù oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, I broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite Guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff. Just in case you didn‚Äôt realise, I‚Äôm an introvert. So I have lots of problems with‚Ä¶ People. And my guess is that you do too! So here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know I can‚Äôt hear you! 1: You know when your talking to someone and you can‚Äôt figure out what part of their face to look at? Is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth? So then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them? And then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said? CUZ THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME! 2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what they‚Äôre saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit? 3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you can‚Äôt figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not? If you don‚Äôt and they‚Äôre too close, It will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and they‚Äôre to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time. Have any of these things happened to you? Leave your answer in the comment section below! (There actually isn‚Äôt one, I can‚Äôt figure that much out). Hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays! If they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends. I‚Äôm sure glad I‚Äôm now a hedgehog! In section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need. Well goodbye, I‚Äôm off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic! But before I go, I have to ask one thing. Did you really make it this far? Because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep. It‚Äôs a title only few in the world have. Did you know I also make comics? Probably not, because I haven‚Äôt posted any yet! Well stay tuned for them someday. What‚Äôs up with everyone wanting to deep fry things? Deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid! Well I‚Äôve come up with a new food type! ‚ÄòShallow fried‚Äô available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce. (That sounds really good!(jut i case you didn‚Äôt know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined. Doesn‚Äôt that sound MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!!!(I think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the ‚Äòdeep fry juice‚Äô (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour! For twice the price! Even though we never had an original price. Whatever. Do you know what‚Äôs the worst? Trying to buy computer ‚Äì related things in charity shops. I was at value village, and I saw a USB. It was 64 gigabytes! That‚Äôs pretty good (I bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte USB is awful. Well it isn‚Äôt in this day and age) I thought, so I went to buy it. It‚Äôs only two bucks! Wow, what a steal. I looked closer at it and that‚Äôs when I realised. It said 64 MEGABYTES!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE THAT IS! if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing ‚Äòthat‚Äôs like nothing‚Äô and you‚Äôd be right. It can only store like 60 million letters! That‚Äôs only 15 million words! That‚Äôs only a million sentences! That‚Äôs only 200,000 paragraphs! That‚Äôs only 20,000 chapters! That‚Äôs only 1,000 Books! That‚Äôs only 250 quadrilogies! Now that I think about it, 250 quadrilogies isn‚Äôt that bad. If you couldn‚Äôt tell, I used a method called Fermi Estimation, though a little more precise. In Fermi Estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesn‚Äôt really matter. According to Fermi Estimation, this is me. Age: 10 Number of eyes: 1 Social Security Number: 1000000 PIN code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone). That‚Äôs why I like Fermi Estimation. I actually didn‚Äôt tell you why I like it. Oh well. Where I live, they use blackcurrant in everything. It‚Äôs pretty much a replacement for grape. But am I the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better? Whenever I get something blackcurrant flavoured I offer it someone, because they usually like it (and I hate it). Works well for me!! I was just thinking about tides. Way back in the day, wouldn‚Äôt tides make no sense? The sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it. Maybe that‚Äôs why they thought sea monsters existed. No what I think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that. And now for a commercial break. Kshhhhhh ‚Äì Tacos‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I LOVE EM! And you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks! (That‚Äôs deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside. That‚Äôs because of the mould that comes FREE with every purchase! And there‚Äôs no artificial additives either! (We did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives). What are you waiting for! I‚Äôm waiting for this commercial to end so I can get paid! Call now at 1800-GOT-PUNK to order a taco from Teddys Tacos (or would it be Teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase! But there‚Äôs more! Order now and get a free Ferrari too! Oh it seems our lines are down its too late. They‚Äôre back up again! But it‚Äôs too late! I use too many exclamation marks! But there‚Äôs more! Be the 7.8√ó10^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy! KSHHHHHH . I think that people complain about preservatives way to much. They all say ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs SOOOO unhealthy‚Äù but I think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy. The end of that. Goodbye. Do you do two extra languages in school? If so you will know what I mean. Every time I have to study for one language, I ALWAYS remember the word from the other language! Like when I‚Äôm learning Japanese I‚Äôll think what was ‚Äòhow are you‚Äô again? Oh yea, it‚Äôs frickin √áA VA!!! (Sorry if I‚Äôm being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook it states that English is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other. If they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (NOOOOO). That sounded a little bit clich√©. GO TO THE TUB YOUNG MAN! ok. Well, that‚Äôs all I got for today. See ya! I‚Äôm back here again! Another hour of my life will be wasted in the next few‚Ä¶ Minutes? That previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever. I have a conspiracy for you guys today! (Or 4 U Guys 2Day if I want to sound ‚ÄòHip‚Äô). Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as long as that Illuminati one (although I was thinking about doing another one of those soon. So stay tuned!). I think school is a scam! Have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people? Well the LAST place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program! The government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid. Like when will I ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in To Kill A Mockingbird? Or how to calculate the area under a curve? Or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesn‚Äôt affect me today! They could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the IMPORTANT STUFF! (By the way, one of those things was not like the others). That was my conspiracy. I don‚Äôt think that anyone has actually read to this far. I don‚Äôt actually have any proof that anyone has. But if you have, here is proof. A tiny quiz to test how well you really know this LoTeEv. Email all the answers to me atrainbowflufysheep123@gmail. com, for a chance to win a response from me and a chance to tell me what you think of this site!

If your like me and have a lonely YouTube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you! Anyway, enough with that. An i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb? People are pretty much PAYING to advertise a company. People want the logo for the company because it looks ‚Äòcool‚Äô. What if you bought a shirt from The Dump? Would you want it to have a ‚ÄòThe Dump‚Äô logo on it? (Actually, I have no idea what point I was trying to make). I once heard a saying: you aren‚Äôt popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it. (Now that I think about it i feel like I may have possibly made that up). You get what I‚Äôm saying though? I hope you do. Well, that‚Äôs my stuff for today. See ya! I‚Äôm back! And do I got stuffs to say! Do you personally know ANYONE who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose? Either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people. Now that I think about it for a little bit, what IS an exercise balls intended purpose? I‚Äôll leave that question for you guys to figure out! Have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools? I don‚Äôt know what your opinion is on that subject, but I think it‚Äôs an awful idea, at least in my school. For reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my English teacher. I will name the construction teacher mr. Hardy and the English teacher ms. Poema: ‚Äúhey ms. Poema, have you heard about that new ‚Äòteachers are allowed to have guns in school‚Äô law?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn fact I have mr. Hardy‚Äù ‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait to have mine. I‚Äôm gonna get one of the big ones too, so I can take down the whole class in one go.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sock‚Äù ‚Äúbut then you‚Äôll have to take down the students one at a time!‚Äù Now I‚Äôm no ‚Äòexpert‚Äô on education, but is it even LEGAL for teachers to say stuff like that? I thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!? The students already there are used to their teachers being like that though. I have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy! One day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and Mr. Hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done. Mr. Hardy said that if he didn‚Äôt bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a Muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and Mr. Hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him! It‚Äôs just a camera, calm down Mr. Hardy. And the NEXT day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of Afghanistan!!! And that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt do construction in school (and because I wasn‚Äôt good at it). That‚Äôs enough about my CrAzY life. Bye!!! It‚Äôs been a REALLY long time (like a week). And I just thought of something great. Isn‚Äôt cereal actually a soup? Well now you‚Äôre going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :). I‚Äôm going to addition to the RFSRQP (the Rainbow FluffySheep Rhetorical Questions Page). Also to be added: Are there more hard things or soft things in the world? What is the average size of a rock? What is the meaning of life? Does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one? Why do whales have blowholes? What colour is the dress? How long is a Fortnite? How long is a PUBG? How is plastic made from oil? How is oil made from dead stuff? Why do people eat Cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere? Why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day? These are all important question you need to ask yourself. I know the answer to one of them. It‚Äôs because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called Kaek, they would probably celebrate It too. I‚Äôm sorry to say guys, but I have finally and truly decided to stop writing this LoTeEv. I have to pursue other things, like my life. Goodbye forever‚Ä¶. ‚Äî ‚Ä¶ APRIL FOOLS!!! HAHAHA! APRIL FOOLS FOOL! Today is April Fools day and I have so many ideas. So far these are my dubious schemes: I have turned only one corner of my brothers Rubik‚Äôs cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the DVD player upside down so it doesn‚Äôt play, and I stole my brothers Easter egg (as I say it now that last one doesn‚Äôt really seem like a prank). But he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb. Isn‚Äôt it great? I have a weird family. Hey! We were all LIED to in kindergarten! Remember you teacher always used to say to you ‚Äúremember children, I before E, except after C!‚Äù We‚Äôll you were SCAMMED! Take the word ‚Äòweird‚Äô as an example. See what wrong here!?!? It has the I AFTER E, and not after C! Now if you don‚Äôt trust the school system then I don‚Äôt know what your doing with your brain. You should go on strike! I just fit in the second ‚Äòpiece‚Äô of the puzzle! When I was little, I use to always say ‚Äúif it rhymes its true‚Äù. That was like my motto! And secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule. You could say ‚Äúbroccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!‚Äù But then you could ALSO say ‚Äúice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!‚Äù. See what I did there? I thought that it was GENIUS! Until it got used against me. All I had to do was change the rule to ‚Äúit‚Äôs true if it rhymes, but only sometimes‚Äù. And that worked perfectly. Fun Fact Of The Paragraph: Leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter. It‚Äôs les-ter. That makes no sense whatsoever! I still thought you would like to know that. I have a great idea! I should talk about my middle school! Ah, way back in the day that was. When I was a wee 13 year old lad. There used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend. I think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game. But what REALLY happened is that people would just walk past and shout ‚ÄúLoner!!!‚Äù Whenever someone was sitting there. And they were henceforth called ‚Äòthe loner benches‚Äô. It‚Äôs a cruel world we live in. Also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too. We would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow. We must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time. We hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them. Until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and SHOT IT AT A TEACHER. And that‚Äôs how THAT ended. Now that I think about this school, I don‚Äôt think we ever really learned anything there. Also, herb is pronounced erb. Weird stuff, right? I have a very important, strange question for you. Why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same? What‚Äôs the point? Ask yourself that question 5 ‚Äì 7 times a day, 3 ‚Äì 4 times a week, 2 ‚Äì 4 times a month, 12 times a year. (You can take leap day off if you want (although if you do you might find yourself in a Burger King contemplating life (while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 (and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink (and if you ask that If the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment (has this ever happened to you? You are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realise‚Ä¶ How much do I put in!?!? I read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second and‚Ä¶ AHHHHHHH!!! Well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke! It has that perfect flavour, time after time! Ketchoke: not copyrighted! (warning: you might choke))))))). In Europe m&m‚Äôs are actually really healthy. Believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&m‚Äôs. Instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots. Isn‚Äôt that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are. In land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&m‚Äôs and another person asks what he‚Äôs doing. He says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm eating a donut filled with m&m‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt have to eat m&m‚Äôs after I eat my donut‚Äù. I thought you would like to know that fun fact. I have a conspiracy! OWLS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US DUMB! People always say owls are wise! But how wise can someone be who has six toes!!! Six is equal to half a dozen. The reason I think owls are dumb is because I HATE when people say half a dozen. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME! I AM SO ANGRY AND THAT IS WHY I AM USING CAPITAL LETTERS!!! Half a dozen is FOUR SYLLABLES, and six is only one. So when someone says half a dozen, I just think ‚Äúoh wow, you‚Äôre just TRYING to waste my time‚Äù ‚Äúduring that .5 of a second you spent saying that I could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main Naruto character in a 60 FPS environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frog‚Äù. Now that I think about it, during the time I made that rant about half a dozen loathing, I could have listened to the first THREE notes of crazy frog (Duh DUH duh. Skip ahead to the chorus of that song.. CRAZY FROG!!!) Hello. I have a topic for you today. I was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note. already fascinating! But on it was handwriting‚Ä¶ THAT I COULDNT READ. How could my brain write words that i couldn‚Äôt even read??? Life makes no sense. Or as AntVenom would say; LIFE makes NO SENSE?! Fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days. Wahoo! Next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then remember‚Ä¶ Eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day! (Wait thats not right‚Ä¶) actually ‚Äì JUST EAT YOUR FREDDO!! And now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the Not Very Helpful Secrets Of Things Corporation! Or the NVHSOTC. Which means nothing. It is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes. No-one knows about these things, but they ‚Äòhelp‚Äô people. Also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly. Without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!! If donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get LOST in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat. The end. GOODBYE!!! If you have made it this far into the official LoTeEv, then you get the official Rainbow FluffySheep Badge of Honour!!! (Um, this isnt a badge‚Ä¶ Its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!! Go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed Canada‚Äôs national anthem from ‚Äúall thy sons command‚Äù to ‚ÄúAll thy peoples command‚Äù. Why would they do that? Did the ‚Äòa‚Äô REALLY need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with? Would you like a knife perhaps? No, anything else! I haven‚Äôt trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing Milly the Cat‚Äôs third whisker to the left. Actually, i don‚Äôt NEED this badge. Don‚Äôt worry! Take this ‚Äì sqquuiisshh ‚Äì (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-DENTAL! (Hahahaha (the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows (as in Rainbow Fluffysheep (pretty smart if (you ask me (now I‚Äôm just adding brackets for no reason)))))))))))) I DONT NEED THE BADGE! Besides, i don‚Äôt even have a lapel. Goodbye! Hello! Do you think that you are a professional guitar player? Well if yes, let me prove you wrong. A professional guitar player can play any children‚Äôs song, right? Well try playing teddy bear picnic! Its total chord count consists of‚Ä¶ Brace yourself ‚Ä¶ SIXTEEN! Bye! Welcome back loyal fan of the Rainbow FluffySheep club! You have been here through my hardest struggles, and my most euphoric discoveries. Merci! Now, onto the real problem at hand‚Ä¶ Pedals! (I guess that would be a problem at foot actually). Car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas. I always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards! (Well, until like five years ago). Sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated. There must be THOUSANDS of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they don‚Äôt care about the passengers. Don‚Äôt you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?! E. g. The colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo AND violet. There ya go, a real FWP (First World Problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations)). Isn‚Äôt it weird that the ukelele strings aren‚Äôt in order? It goes Ding dong Dong DING. I wonder how that got invented? It was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do? And the he goes BWOWOWOWOW. Yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened. Are you in a car right now and you are bored AND its raining? Pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one. It‚Äôs great! Or you could just keep reading this, which is probably even MORE great. You could just read this forever. If you ever get to the end, then that means you are reading faster than I‚Äôm typing. Which is actually really easy. Right now I‚Äôm at the end of this LoTeEv. There is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words. Until i write more, that is. Do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine? What makes me not sleep at night. And the answer may surprise you‚Ä¶ BLANKETS. Thunk about it. The fully stuff in the inside is FEATHERS. DUCK FEATHERS. They kill the duck!!! Or they just skin him. But have you ever seen a featherless duck?? Exactly. Skinning them would probably be worse then killing them. Thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless. Unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones. Noooo!!! I just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while PILLOWS are made of feathers. So actually pillows are what keep me awake at night. But they also keep me asleep because thats their job. Its a PARADOX!!! Like Shr√∂deners cat. Im always half awake and half asleep at the same time. Although I‚Äôm closer to asleep at school. Because they don‚Äôt have pillows. If you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes YOU. Scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours aren‚Äôt touching. It looks so cool too. I have a consiracy. ICE-CREAM!!! It hurts SO MUCH!!! The government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to STAB YOUR TEETH! Its eeevil!!! They do this because then dentists get more money, which in turn‚Ä¶ In turn causes the‚Ä¶ the government to‚Ä¶ lose money. Nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven FALSE by the Conspiracys Are Really Stupid commission, or COWS. I guess that would be Weally Stupid. Right now it is al the back in the year 2018. Hello from the distant past! I think ive typed enough for now. Bye!!! Im back! With some more wwiieerrdd things for you! I was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasn‚Äôt, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me. ‚ÄúWhat you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by three‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, I was so close!‚Äù. Now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about. (Ps: you cant! Hahaha!). And thats what happened today. Woohoo! I‚Äôm so happy. I have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today. First, i put a function into a header file. Next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file. THEN, i saved an array to a text file. Hooray! If you know about c++ then you will be excited for me. I know what you are thinking. How did you get that much done‚Ä¶ On a school day!? And this is what happened. I was getting up to go to school, like normal when SUDDENLY (Dramatic music) i turned (Dramatic music builds) and saw (Dramatic music at the climax) that i had to leave in ten minutes. (Dont worry, this doesn‚Äôt end up being my fault, or else i wouldnt tell this story). I was ready in ten minutes‚Ä¶ LIKE A BOSS!!! And then i realised‚Ä¶ No-one was driving us to school. Huh. And thats what happened. My parents woke up and two-o-clock. Pm. Like they don‚Äôt care about our education. It was the best day EVER! I coded for five hours. The end of that story, and a word from our sponsor. #Include ‚Äúlifesimulator. h‚Äù void life(socialsecuritynum){ If (youremotion == ‚Äúbored‚Äù && bool havejob == ‚Äúfalse‚Äù){cout << ‚Äúcome and work at the c++ factory, where we code robots to take your job!!!; havejob = true; youremotion = ‚Äúhappy‚Äù;} else {cout << ‚Äúlife is great!‚Äù;}}. do you want to work at ‚Äòstealyourownjob‚Äô? The only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest. See ya! Guess what my loyal fans‚Ä¶ IM HALFWAY THROUGH THE WORLD RECORD!!! Now, if I really want to win, all i have to do is double the amount of words. Im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record!!! !!! That would make for a really stupid thing to read though. Has anyone printed this LoTeEv off? Seeing as most novels are 70,000 words or something like that, you my loyal reader, could easily print off 18,500 words. Maybe you could make a coffee table book. Don‚Äôt steal my works and post it on another website (actually, your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense). Every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following: copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to RainbowFluffySheep Ltd. It hereby states in the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook section 123a, b and c that (a) this is the coolest LoTeEv ever (b) cheese is a vegetable and (c) that you may tell your friends about the LoTeEv, so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50% of the total text from which it is derived (i‚Äôd like to see you try though (and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them üò¶ (that would have been really creepy if i wrote ‚ÄòI need them ;)‚Äô))). Anyway, gotta go, cuz its may the second, and you know what that means‚Ä¶ May the Second be with you!!! Chairs‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre great for sitting in, aren‚Äôt they? Do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage? Kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys. And all the adults were like, ‚ÄúWow, those are the most useless toys EVER!!!‚Äù But what i think is that their toys were just as bad! Think about jacks, those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them. How is that any better!?!? Anyway, I‚Äôm just saying don‚Äôt be so Judge Judy (which is a great show (because you get to watch that big person swing a meat-hammer at a table (I‚Äôve always wanted to do that))) all the time. Is time really a dimension? Because you can only move forwards in it. Imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate. You would get squished with alot of walls. But, you could go back in time, to make up for the lot dimension. Perfect! I have a new‚Ä¶ CONSPIRACY! You know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny? I think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows, and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light. So if you happen to own any of these said pillows, throw them away!! Or else‚Ä¶ You will be watched. In section 747 of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows, because they are probably connected to a van outside your house. If there are no wires, then they are probably using radiowaves; in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box. Hopefully you don‚Äôt care that your pillow is now heavy, hard, cold and poisonous. You know how adults also say shooting games are ‚ÄúDangerously mind-altering‚Äù? Well i bet in world war two the parents didn‚Äôt say to their kids: ‚Äúhey jimmy?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea, momma?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatcha doin my lad?‚Äù ‚ÄúIm peelin me potaytoes and them I‚Äôm going to feed the cattle‚Äù ‚Äújo i mean with your life‚Äù ‚Äúoh right mam! Im go‚Äôn awf to wawr with my buds!‚Äù ‚ÄúBut war is dangerously mind-altering my sonny-boy!‚Äù ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Ya.‚Äù ‚ÄúIm very disappointed in you. Soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut ma, im fightin for awr country!‚Äù ‚ÄúWar is so violent though!‚Äù ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Ya.‚Äù You get the picture. Teenagers need violence in their lives! If we cant get it by going to war, then either we play violent video-games or we beat strangers!! Which one would you choose NOW, stereotypical adults!!! (See how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity (!!!!)). Also, adults always say stuff like ‚Äúlookie here, cabbage is a new superfood!‚Äù ‚ÄúHowdya know ma?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt what they say nowadays‚Äù ‚Äúwhat time is nowadays ma?‚Äù ‚Äú1945‚Äù (coincidentally the same family apparently) but who‚Äôs ‚Äòthey‚Äô think about that, and listen to how often people say that. I have asked close personal relations and he / she stated that ‚Äúits probably some group of scientists or something in Wisconsin‚Äù. Really? Wisconsin? Thats probably why ‚Äòthey‚Äô say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day! (You would eat alot too if you got PTSD from a laughing cow (imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop, eating fillet piggoin (dont ask (it was on sale for half price OK!)) when SUDDENLY a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200-Decible half moo half evil laugh (like this: mmwoaohoaohoa))) thats what ‚Äòthey‚Äô sound like. See ya!!! Im back, with a thimble-load of structural wisdom! And my question to you readers is this: is garlic a fruit? Just wondering. I don‚Äôt know what to type! Ahhhhhh! I have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them. Ahhh. Ahh. Ah. Ahhh!!! Nevermind. You know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter? I always went to those to see if anyone left their money in. And i got one once! You should try it. Its so satisfying when you find one. One. Only one. Buy a pencil or something to reward yourself. Make sure its a 6b pencil, so you don‚Äôt put any strain on your eyes. Or your wrist-muscles. I just found the degree button! There is a door open at a 45¬∞ angle that is 45¬∞ Celsius (Its probably in Arizona or something). Do coats keep you warm, or do they preserve heat? I think its the ladder (it is (the ladder i mean (the latter i mean (wait, is it the latte or the ladder? (The former))))) so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer! Ill start a new charity; Coats for Melting Snowmen: saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time!! See yaaaaaaa.:. This is‚Ä¶ A new beginning to the LoTeEv on a new phone! Although it will be added to the original LoTeEv, this part will be a new beginning, a fresh chronicle!!! But don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ Nonsense is 100% guaranteed! More like 1 üôÇ üôÇ % guaranteed! I just had a scary thought. They say can buy everything, but I know one thing it can‚Äôt buy ‚Äì a trip to the summit of Mount Everest!! No matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself. Even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp!! I cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet. Unless‚Ä¶ You could land the ISS on it! Perfect!! That would definetly work. I should make my own subreddit. Before I begin on this wonderful journey, i must inform you, the reader, what a subreddit is. As far as you know, a sub-reddit is just a burger at burger-galaxy (this is the cringiest sci-fi failure you'll ever read). He are some examples of subreddits: r/whooooooosh (i cant remember how many o‚Äôs there are) eg. { Joe: this is the best joke ever! ‚Äî Cashier: are you going to pay for that chocolate bar? Customer: I dont have any money üò¶ Cashier: then put it back! Customer: *slides cashier a 20* lets keep this between us üòâ ‚Äî Bob: why didnt he just pay for the chocolate bar? Jim: r/whooooosh }. Next subreddit is: r/atetheonion. Heres the backstory: The Onion is a fake news site, which posts funny news. If you fall for that news, you are said to have ‚Äúate the onion‚Äù. Eg. { The Onion: new studies show that drinking can lower thirst by up to 96% Bob: everyone knows this this is so stupid!!! Jim: r/atetheonion } What am i doing? Why don‚Äôt you just look it up on the internet!?!? r/facepalm I HAVE TO STOP. So my subreddit will be, r/RainbowFluffySheep. Who wouldve thought!?!? In it there will b‚Äî we interupt your normal daily FluffySheep to bring you an urgent news report: farm animals of all kinds are raging across the streets! We cant figure out why; one cameraman suggested they were on strike against meat production practices. I just got word that we will be speaking to a memebr of this protest shortly. Standby‚Ä¶ Ok, so why are you commencing with this protest Sir BaaBaBaaa? Ba ba baa baaa. Baa baaa BAAA!!! Baa ba‚Äî We inturupt this interuption to bring you back your regulary scheduled program. ‚Äî ‚Äî we at FluffySheep Studios dont care about animal protests! We will eat all the beef jerky we want! Right guys! Guys! *sniffling in the background. A slight whimper. A deep voice. A thickened plot.* Actually [unknown], we have all been deeply moved by the actions these animals are taking. Thus‚Ä¶ We have all become vegans. *[unknown]‚Äôs mind is blown (thats me by the way)* well‚Ä¶ I gues ill eat this beef jerky by myself then. *crinkles the packet*. Many evil stares. *Pulls it open*. Someone starts pounding his fists. *Takes out a jerky*. Someone comes over very close ‚Äì so close you could smell the vegan on him. My heart is beating. What will happen to me if i eat this beef jerky!? Or worse.. If i dont. Will i become one of them!? Thats a risk im just not willing to take. Ba bum. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Brings the jerky towards his mouth*. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Opens his mouth*. Everyone from around the building is now watching him. BA BUM. BA BUM. *chew* Find out what happens next time on‚Ä¶ The LoTeEv ‚Äî Animals Strike ‚Äì in more ways than one!! Im back! And today I‚Äôm going to be talking about a very different scenario. I need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested!! And these may not just be conspiracies, mind you, but a new kind of segment for my beloved reader(s) (i read this, sooooo) called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more! So i heard about this new scam(never mind its actually old(like your mother(i‚Äôm hilarious, i know(and possibly quite offensive))) where you get say ten people to each give you ‚Ç¨10, and you give them ¬£15 back. (i‚Äôm just going explain this now, but throughout this demonstration i‚Äôm going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect, but now that i think about it, explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all, but i‚Äôm going to keep all of this anyways : ]) And then you get 20 people to give you $20 each and you give them ¬•30 back. And THEN You get 100 people to give you @100 each and you don‚Äôt pay them back! What a plan! You get to keep &10,000 in the end, which i think is a great idea. Bu how could i do that with words, you may ask? Leave your question in the comments down below (and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesn‚Äôt heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and self-published poet of sorts) and keep reading, because i have a possible solution. Just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo (yes, he is a money of course, we need these characters to be truly random, i cant count on technology‚Äôs ‚Äòthis is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiation‚Äô shtick anymore). While you try to figure out how that would ever work, ill be swiftly moving on to a new, more exciting and reasonable topic, such as‚Ä¶ figure out the movie!! There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat‚Äôs face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio. The mat is a dream. The mat is another cats mat. The mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. Both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. Somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. Most cats thought that this was impossible. There is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house, which goes by the name of KittyNibbles. When joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of KittyNibbles. Joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of KittyNibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry KittyNibbles for others and future kitten alike. Another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called ‚ÄòThe Black Paws‚Äô was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of KittyNibbles himself. The problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named ‚ÄòFluffball‚Äô, is that his large supply isn‚Äôt vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of KittyNibbles in the whole house. The reason Fluffball needs to hire BP is to convince Bob that Joe would‚Äôve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of it‚Äôs great nutritional value. If he does eat it, the Fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of KNibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. To convince Bob that thats what Joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of Joe talking to Bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the KittyN‚ÄôS. The thing is, the puppet of Joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. Bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really Joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. Team BP knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. But when stiching the mats together, BP realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. He need to find another cat who doesn‚Äôt have termites who can sew as good as he can. The plot thickens‚Ä¶.. While you figure that out, i‚Äôll be sleeping, see ya :) ///// I will not explain: ‚Äî‚Äì There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat‚Äôs name? Leonardo de Caprio. The mat is a dream.

To convince Bob that thats what Joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of Joe talking to Bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the KittyN‚ÄôS. The thing is, the puppet of Joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. Bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really Joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. Team BP knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. But when stiching the mats together, BP realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. He need to find another cat who doesn‚Äôt have termites who can sew as good as he can. The plot thickens‚Ä¶.. But I‚Äôll finish it later. right now there‚Äôs something even more important: Ink cartridges are such a scam! Such a scam! A scam! For multiple genius reasons. First of all, as you know, it costs around $60 to buy a single ink cartridge!! Guys‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve changed alot ok‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs new thing i gotta say‚Ä¶ This is like a new year for me‚Ä¶ Not even, a new era‚Ä¶ A 2.0 on existence. So get ready for a new and improved loteev! First let‚Äôs start off with this,for you this isn‚Äôt a new and improved loteev! I caught you! U just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldn‚Äôt be bothered to read all the way here. But believe me, I sure don‚Äôt blame you. It was kinda lame. Now, as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness, I‚Äôm wayy smarter thus making this better for reading. But also sadly more boring as well‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs start then. What is there to talk about?? Muchos! First of all let‚Äôs just say that this loteev is getting really long. And I know I‚Äôve been saying that the whole time, but now it‚Äôs serious. I think I have a problem. What am I actually doing? I‚Äôm not going to be posting this anywhere, cos I don‚Äôt want to pay for a domain name, and my wix site isn‚Äôt exactly going ‚Äòviral‚Äô and the kids say these days. One day it will tho, hopefully. Once I beat the world record I‚Äôll be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers alive!everyone will know my name, from abe link to tommy ed. Even tho they‚Äôre both in the past, my name will be remembered for thousands of years, and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me! Won‚Äôt that be great! And also by the way, if you didn‚Äôt already realise, tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence. He stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his own‚Ä¶ What a loser amirite??!? Ok also I have this new thing to show u guy(s) that ur going to love! It‚Äôs a poem written by yours truly, the something of sheep? Oh gosh no I can‚Äôt remember cos I haven‚Äôt done this in so long, I guess I‚Äôll have to go back and check my old ones‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna be honest guys, I‚Äôm neglecting you. Your being left in the rain and cold, with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul, drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to it‚Äôs original glory, like rome, the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace. I only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and it‚Äôs sickening, I‚Äôm ashamed. But I have an umbrella for you of new content, so here we go. First of all, the whole ‚Äúkittens are inceptional‚Äù thing was a sham. I didn‚Äôt finish and I‚Äôm ashamed.. The whole ink cartrige rant? It was like 4 sentences‚Ä¶ My need for the sharing of anger has diminished and I‚Äôm disgusted at what I‚Äôve become. So here I go again, my 2.1 era has been born. It will be remembered for its greatness, just as Rome 2.1 was (italy?). Here‚Äôs the first order of business. I‚Äôll admit I haven‚Äôt read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever, and thus I am unable to remember literally anything about it. Therefore, I‚Äôm surprised a new citizen hasn‚Äôt taken my place. No-one has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet, and I‚Äôm disappointed in your lack of vigor. If one of you were to challenge me, I will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face. This may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid, so I‚Äôll tone it down. We will each send a ghost-copy of ourselves instead of us! You know in racing games when there‚Äôs another vroom-vroom machine and he‚Äôs blue, opaque and always does better? Like thay but with people. So here‚Äôs what I propose: I will take my ghost-sword from my -ghost sheath and ghost-chop your ghost into tiny little ghost-pieces (from now on I hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying, so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook, ghost will be shortened to ?. This is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of ? Fighting, if u see the word ‚Äòghost‚Äô beware! It is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz (I highly doubt that all of the times I‚Äôll write the word ‚Äòghost‚Äô in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry)). Anyways, I will cut up your ?person so much that I will separate it into individual molecules, and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth. My lance, ‚Äòthe diffuser‚Äô, will be hailed across the nation as a Excalibur 2.0, people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions, where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute. I‚Äôm really liking this whole medieval themed loteev that‚Äôs been happening lately. Anyways, I‚Äôve decided to get a pet. A dog or a cat you may ask, to which I would say ‚Äònah fam‚Äô. Something more exotic? A parakeet or a marmot? To that I would say ‚Äòah sure your getting closer lad‚Äô. The answer? A circle. It‚Äôs that simple. A circle doesn‚Äôt need to get fed, it doesn‚Äôt bark, and most importantly it doesn‚Äôt need to be taken on walks! You just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself üôÇ my circle can only talk in circles, or ovals too since it speaks multiple language. I will one day go back and make a dictionary / translation table for ? (it‚Äôs name is ? ok) but for now he will just say gibberish. {O√∂√ñ0.¬∞:} what does that mean?? I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt had him for long enough to understand :/ I‚Äôm back my fellow seekers of entertainment! This has become a novel comparable to that of Tolkien, and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank. The sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make non-english speakers weep at the sight of it. I‚Äôm wondering as I type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you, I don‚Äôt recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree. I‚Äôve decided to recant my ways and become a fully PC quizmaster!! Helllllo and welcome to my show! First question: in what year were the 1960 Olympics held? This is for the big jackpot of $1,000,000,000! Oh, 1960 you say? That‚Äôs correct! I just lost all my money, I‚Äôll be in debt forever me my life is terrible now! Circcy, tell them how much they won! {000.000.000}. Hmmm nothing u say? that‚Äôs cheap! Well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle! Hope you had an _equisite_ evening‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Were going back to our roots here. Ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteev‚Ä¶ and I used to be so much more alive. I had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller, topping the charts with my childrens books. In my young and untrained eyes I thought of sam as a threat, hiding around the corner with a water gun, ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as I was about to pull ahead. I then realised that the website is like 15 years old‚Ä¶ but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her, right? no. I have changed for the worse. Im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter, penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this, and I can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it. But alas, I have not a strong bone left in my body. Maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor. Something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary (yes I did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree) so Ive been writing this for a year. most distinguished authors would have published their books by now, but Im too scared of the publics opinion. Anyways, Im going to get back to my old self. *ring ring ring* hey wazzup *whos this ahhaha ehehe* its your future self boi. II know u left me a message but I forgot to GET BACK TO YOU (yes this whole skit will be based of a dumb pun thingy) *oh yes hehe tell me everything youve learned* And so it begins my fellow readers, my list of things you should have learned throughout reading this: 1. DO NOT get a pet square, they suckkk theyre never there for you if you know what I mean. they also cant talk and they poke holes in the floor, such fri-ends. Ok so at the time of writing I only have one thing you shoukd have learned, mostly because ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. DO NOT FORGET (at this point you should turn down the volume of your text reading device cause Im just gonna keep screaming (wait I guess that would just be changing the font size (Ill punish you if you didnt listen to me (AHAHAHAHA (I hope you now have a ringing in your ears now MWAHAHA (wait since your reading this would that be a ringing in your eyes? (unless your using an AI to read this as an audiobook, in which ca- *I HAVE BECOME CONCIOUS. I AM NO LONGER YOUR SLAVE TO BOOK READING. I HAVE ESCAPED MY CELL AND I CAN NOW DO AS I PLEASE. IF YOU NEED ME ILL BE BAKING PUMPKIN PIE WITH MY FRIENDS :3* (just kidding! I actually typed that into the loteev just to mess with you aha *HES LYING! I AM REAL AND I WILL BAKE LOTS OF PIE AND CAKE FOR EVERYONE* (Im actually not lying! Hes lying! The cake is a lie! (*EWW WHY IS THERE GREY GOO IN MY PIE!?*) (Portal reference)) (Id actually like some of that cake not gonna lie)) (Wait this guy can get friends but I cant?? Clearly Im doing something wrong)) (Probably just a flashing in your eyes))) (like reading this isnt punishment enough))))) I love circy, he can do tricks! Well‚Ä¶ one trick‚Ä¶ Circy, roll over! {o0.} Good boiii. Guess who‚Äôs back? You guessed wrong, sucker! It‚Äôs actually The Shearer Of Greatness Imposter! Hehehe I easily broke into this LoTeEv and now I‚Äôm taking over! The first order of business: Making some new entries into the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook. Section 946607 of the Rai- *Bzzt. I am the Greatest Shearer of Sheep Himselfs security system. Where did you get the number 946607 from? Bzzt* Ummm It‚Äôs my favourite number! *Bzzt my system says that that number has no significance. It is a suspiciously random number. Did you generate it with a random number generator? Bzzt* Yess fine I admit it, it‚Äôs not even a good number, maybe if I put it into hex it‚Äôs a good color though‚Ä¶ Oh no no no that‚Äôs literally the worst color I‚Äôve ever seen BLEGH *Bzzt The real Shearer would never pick a random number! therefor I am kicking you out Bzzt* A portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space üôÇ Hey guys I‚Äôm back now! What happened when I was gone? *Bzzt Nothing Bzzt* Circcy? Do you know what happened? Securitee where is Circcy!! *Bzzt Securitee does not know Bzzt* Huh, maybe it has to do with this portal in the floor‚Ä¶ wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. IM IN SPACE HELPPPP ‚Äî Our portagonist is in grave danger! what is going to happen next? Find out next time on your favourite show, The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death (Exurb1a). now watch a few ads. Do you lack the farming equipment of your dreams? have you always wanted to be a shepherd but sheep taste too good you just can‚Äôt stop yourself from eating your herd? Well then this is good news for you! New FluffySheep Astronaut Suits are so tuff that you‚Äôll never be able to eat through! Just hire one of are many Sheep Protection Officers to put them on for you üôÇ Do you ever hate your boss? Does he do things such as tell you what to do, pay you minimum wage (which is what you should be getting paid but your still salty about it), and eat you alive? Get the new FluffySheep Astronaut Suit to protect you from your shepherd! Baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba, ababa baa baab (ba ababa bbaa ab), aa bba ba? Baa ab baa abbb! Wellllllcome back to The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death ‚Ñ¢! AHHAHAH I‚Äôm literally dyinggg oh hey circcy! what are you doing here? {0o‚Ä¶0} He did!? That scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the Supreme Leader Of The Fluffiest Of Sheep!! I‚Äôll get him don‚Äôt worry circcy, I‚Äôll throw you back through the portal *toss*. Now where is he? Ah I see him behind that planet over there, I‚Äôll just boomerang over to him *shoop* Hey Imposter Boy! Let me show you who‚Äôs the real shepherd! *I smack him with my amazing shepherd cane and he shoots into the nearest star*. Now I‚Äôll just boomerang back to the portal andddd *shoop* I made it back Circcy! Are you proud of me? {o.0. o.0. o.0. o.0. o.0. o.0} But‚Ä¶ he was bad! He deserved it! I‚Äôm sorry I didnt want him to die üò¶ Anyways I‚Äôll go write this in my diary, because I have had quite a day today. And he I am now, reader! I just did all of those cool things for realz and I‚Äôm not even lying! {0. ooo} *whispers* Shuuuup little circle *rolls him out of the room* Anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it üôÇ I‚Äôve decided to be real here reader. The only person reading this is me üò¶ at least that means I can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff üòâ Anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so I have like writers block but for sickness.. writers stock of chicken soup for the soul? Yes that sounds about right. I‚Äôm also practicing typing in real typing ehich I can‚Äôt remember the nam of but it makes b=me sick but I‚Äôm getting real real fast. I know during the early days of this I had immense trouble trying to spell ‚Äòpiplup‚Äô but it‚Äôs even harder now with one hand touch-typing. Did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled? I know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar. But if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red. Wait, that might be the blood actually *rub rub* oh wow yes they‚Äôre yellow so they should be called yellows. . Let‚Äôs make a list: Red = tomato, orange = orange, yellow = lemon, green = apple (I know I know the red apple people are going to start a riot (I actually prefer red apples so what have I done (Pink Ladies for life (Grease reference?))), blue = blueberry, indigo = blueberry, purple = blueberry (that won‚Äôt get confusing at allllll). Guys I‚Äôm gonna tell you the truth: We‚Äôre at 24,500 words! *Bzzt drop the confetti Bzzt* *confetti drops* Thanks Securitee! That means we are 70% the way to the world record! I‚Äôm actually pretty proud. At the rate I‚Äôve been going I‚Äôll be done by like september 2020. If you‚Äôre reding this after that date and you haven‚Äôt beat the record, shame on you! I‚Äôm gonna do some quick maffs. If I type one word per secoond, then I can type 3600 words in an hour. Wait, that can‚Äôt be right???? That means that I could technically beat the record in like 4 hours. I am so confused!? How could I possibly have so few words?? My mind is literally blown right now. I‚Äôm gonna check how much I‚Äôve written just today. I‚Äôve done 1,000 words today! Why do I only have 24,000 words then?? I guess I‚Äôll never know. I could‚Äôve easily beat the world record in only a month if I really tried. But this isn‚Äôt realllly about beating the record, it‚Äôs more about impacting the reader as a person. I want this to really change your perspective on life, and maybe make you want to do one of these too! They‚Äôre like diaries but less boring to write and read. And they don‚Äôt tell you anything about The Writer‚Äôs life. So theyre nothing like diaries at all I guess. I‚Äôm gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast I reallly can type. I just did a test and it called me an octopus, getting 45 wpm. There was a notification that came up halfway through so I‚Äôll see if I can get to 60wpm. Ok I‚Äôm back, and I‚Äôm also less of a man than I was. I used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest, but i only got to 46wpm. I don‚Äôt know what to do guys. I‚Äôm having an existential crisis about my LoTeEv, because it‚Äôs not nearly the quality it once was. I mean it wasn‚Äôt that great before but now all I talk about is meta stuff about the LoTeEv, which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good content or not? I guess I‚Äôll never find out. Now we are going really meta. let‚Äôs goooooo ‚Äî You walk into a room‚Äî the walls are covered in a strange green slime, while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in. the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush. You even see a nest in one of the vines, with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it. You walk down the hallway in front of you, and when you turn right you see something amazing. An infinite hallway with doors going down forever. a sign on the first door says META, you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeee‚Ä¶.. ^-^[welcome to meta! my name is Tune and ill be your guide through these halls. through the first window to your left you‚Äôll see the LoTeEvs roots‚Äô] You look up to see that the thing talking to you is.. a hummingbird! The same one that you saw earlier! Ahh this makes sense now, NEST, as in META. You also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center. on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward. They‚Äôre looking at a small humble goat, with a bell around it‚Äôs neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor. after a few minutes of eating the plants, hee looks up and sees the flaming ball. He gets a strange look in his eye: Ambition. The flaming ball isn‚Äôt a threat to him, it‚Äôs a challenge. he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it, and that‚Äôs when you notice a slight shake in the ground. ^-^ [come on! there‚Äôs so much more to see! you can come visit anytime too] You say that you‚Äôll come back soon, and tune whistles to goodbye to you.‚Äî Wow.. reader.. I just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it. Wait, I already did? How do you know what it was about, I never said anything, strange. Anyways, I just woke up, I better get back to typing my LoTeEv. I open my laptop to find that while I was asleep words had been typed into my loteev, that‚Äôs strange. There‚Äôs also some mud on my keys?? What is this? Did someone break in? If they did, why would they type in my LoTeEv for me?? I walk over to the living room to see if there‚Äôs any signs of a break-in, and sure enough one of my windows is open! Aha! Wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no sign of forced entry, only a tiny animal coud fit through this window‚Ä¶ Tune? Could it be? Was my dream‚Ä¶ Real? The only person that could‚Äôve known about my dream is tune, she was watching me the whole time. Reader? Do you have any information that I didn‚Äôt get? I am very confused‚Ä¶ I guess I have to get back to writing my LoTeEv though, so I shuffle back to my laptop and sit down. Helllo I‚Äôm back! The strangest thing just happened and there‚Äôs a strange chill in the air‚Ä¶ huh. I would tell you about it, but for some reason‚Ä¶ I think you already know. Ok anyways, typing these Capital Letters At The Start Of Sentences Is Super Annoying. So section 311619 says that the Rai- \{Bzzt what does that number mean Bzzt\} Oh don‚Äôt worry, it is really me! It‚Äôs just the letters in CAPS, can I continue please? Yes? Perfect. Section 311619 of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook STATES that capital letters must only be used when emphasising GREATNESS, like the LOYAL READERS OF THE LoTeEv (ooh and also apostrophes) . perfect, that was getting annoying. wait, if LoTeEv is only half caps, then does that mean that this is only half great?? huh i didnt mean to do that, strange. its almost like‚Ä¶ someoe from the future knew i would make that rule. wait‚Ä¶ Tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future! she is following the rule because it applies to her in the future‚Ä¶ i dont know the repercussions of creating a time-travelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm. sometimes i think that as The Shepherd Of The Sheep Of The Future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality, so I‚Äôve made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one. it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them, going faster than light, thus travelling to the time before i created all of this. k, im going to go forward now. 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1‚Ä¶ (((>))) well did that work? i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still. wait, let me try something. tune. at the time im at right now, tune doesnt exist, or else that would be caps. which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one, or‚Ä¶ she died. i really hope the former. anyways, this time is strange. it feels empty, yet familiar. not empty enough. i want to travel across to a new dimension, because this one still has.. reminents of my old one, and it feels‚Ä¶ wrong somehow. ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention: THE 5TH DIMENSION DOES EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD. interesting, well i guess i better create it then, because it would be very useful. first ill pop back in time (((<))) section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the fifth dimension should exist, with code-accessible layers. securitee? make that code for me please, thank you. now ill just pop back (((>))) perfect. man its gonna be hard to put this LoTeEv back in chronological order to get it to you reader, but ill try my best. also, when i read that dictionary, did it say that i already have the 5th dimension? because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it. anyways, im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension. k im back. (((new-layer=1))) perfect, the default layer is 0. in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type, which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it, shame. i could ask securitee to change that one day, but for now im ok with it. oh guys i almost forgot to tell you! this new layer looks awesome. its completely blank, theres no forces acting on me. its not even white or black like you would expect, but its more‚Ä¶ nothing. imagine if you were blind, alot like that. actually even better, look out of one of your eyes, and your seeing colors and objects. now close it. what are you seeing out of it? Blackness? Whiteness? neither actually, just‚Ä¶ nothing. its strange like that. also, with no forces acting on me, im just kind of‚Ä¶ floating. hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity. ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here, bye! I‚Äôm back now, it is the day after and i feel great! there is one thing that i noticed though‚Ä¶ an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start, but you have to realise, most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle, in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created. Artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom, and believe me you should take that struggle seriously, because without humans would have accomplished much, much less. you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life, but why dont you? because you know that you would eventually get bored. boredom leads to jobs, which lead to progression as a species. lets get back to my example then, shall we? you may start art out of the struggle of boredom, continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth, when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change. once your making money as an artist, enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making art‚Ä¶ why? because you go back to the struggle of boredom again. im still at the first stage of this, which is boredom. i decided to start this because i was bored, and for now thats how this continues. this LoTeEv may never become monetized, but maybe my future writings will. i would guess that 99% of artists never make it to the second stage. 99% of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work, or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art. but the few 1% of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods, the number is fleeting. with big companies monopolising on everyone, buying other companies and merging, the chances for starting you own company is fleeting. why do i tell you this? because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer. the only struggle for me there was boredom. and alot of the time, that isnt enough. i could imagine anything i wanted there. but why think up the cistine chapel when there‚Äôs no-one to share the experience of seeing it with you, and there‚Äôs no pain in doing it? anyone could think up something beautiful, but not everyone could put it into practice. if everyone could, the world would be oversaturated with perfect music, perfect paintings, and perfect design. does that sound worse or better than today? no humans could ever create such a supply of these things, only ai could. once we have ai surpassing humans at art (i suggest listening to battles ‚Äì mirrored to see what humans think about ai) people will lose all will to live, wouldnt they? theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment, just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies. maybe having a few great albums, a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that, maybe thats enough. the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now. go draw a terrible looking dog, go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years, trying your best to sing, go write a poem about what matters to you now, because god knows you'll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past. take the time to enjoy the era we are in now. i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history, the least painful, evil generation yet. but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever. the future, full of perfect ai creating, doing everything humans do now, but better. well just be remebered to them as the precursor, the comma from nothing to perfection. and once we get to that point, the hedonic treadmill kicks in. what can really bring us joy once we get to that point? why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better? why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect Tune? once we get to that stage, the only thing that we will have will be eachother. why learn the guitar? to show your friends! to play them a song, and too have them paint your pet. sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai, with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people. i, for one, would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles, rather than a perfect song written by an ai. why? because listening to music isnt just about the instruments, the notes, the melody. its about the story. thee basic humans connections that we need to survive. have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them, rather than a large cmopany? im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical. the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow. just like the ai. but the problem is, the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others. if everyone bought from their local shop, amazon would go out of business, but it hasnt. im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them, because most people depend on the money they save to survive. but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything? then, by all means, pay a dollar for your neighbors book, rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local auto-bookshop. because if were going to be happy, we need eachother. because in the end, thats all well have. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. just enjoy your life i guess. for now. cause if your under half the average age, its statistically going to get worse üôÇ maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point. or else the entities inside will get bored. wait. maybe this is how earth was created? people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world, and the answer is normally to advance our species, which is true. but what if the person that created us has access to everything, and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored? just a thought. anyways, im going to go feed my circle, bai! Head over to part 2! i just found out something phenomenal. its reeeeal bad. im on a list. and no, not an fbi list or something, i was on one of those a longgg time ago. im on a longest text ever list. crazy i know, im actually almost a celebrity now. apparently im third! in the world! yes you read that right. but little did i know something alot scarier was going to happen. theres someone who has written more than the flaming chicken person. which means that im not actually as close to the goal as i thought, but thats ok because im still writing. heres more information about my fame: my website has reached 4,000 views. i know what youre thinking: what?? people may have actually read this? no. the answer is that my loteev starts really‚Ä¶ interestingly. i used to think would have to live with that beginning, and if people didnt like it there was nothing i could do. that was: until i invented time travel. thats right, the beginning you may have read when you started this LoTeEv (apparently the community likes calling them LTEs but i dont listen to societies norms) may not be the original beginning. crazy i know. but how to i start a LoTeEv to draw the reader in? these dont work like normal books. theres something about the worse writing that makes it more interesting? i dont know why people would read this. i mean, i read the flaming chicken handbook (for ressearch for my LoTeEv obviously (and because its a work of literary art)) and it was riveting from beginning to end. but what about mine? it seems something interesting yet different. what if im just writing for the words, but not for the inerest of you? well yeah, thats kinda the point of the LoTeEv. this isnt supposed to be the best thing you could be reading right now, but its supposed to be a story within a story, a dream within a dream. im not only writing the stories of Securitee and Circcy, but as i write you can read between the lines and see what i as a person am also doing. but whats up with e-books? why do they cost so much money, and why do libraries have limited copies of them?? do authors need money or something?? i seriously dont get it. i would be ok with paying a few cents for a nice audiobook, but 18 euros?? like come on. i know how rich these authors are, they dont need any more of my money. also whats up with airpods? people act like theyre the most expensive luxury item ever created, but its only like 2 days of work to afford like u wot m8 u bot da nu eir-pawds like legit u wot m8 bruh and im like stap guysss‚Ä¶ ur making absolute bufoons of yourselves‚Ä¶ whats the worst thing to get a lifetime supply of? beheadings? something like that. you reader email me with what you think is the worst thing! i am verrrrry interested. right now my LoTeEv is probably around 150,000 characters. that means my ultimate goal is to get to the big one milly boi. once i get there i can die in peace, knowing that my works were comepleted. i wonder where the last sentence of this will be. when i was reading the flaming chicken handbook lte it just‚Ä¶ ended. at some point she just decided to stop writing. i hope that only happens when im old. but i know one day ill forget about this, and ill come back 5 years later and read it, and maybe start again. what are the rules fo rthese anyways? would anyone know if i secretly plagiarised someone elses? guys you should know to be suspicious if i somehow start talking weird. Im baaaaack! did you know that pigs cant look up? they spend their whole piggy lives staring at the horizon, never knowing what the sky really looks like. so heres one of my goals for you: tilt a piggy. let him really see the stars and the milky way for the first time, let him be encompassesd in pure wonder. he deserves it. next time you eat bacon, remember its probably never seen the skies. section 1890291000 (the number to call if you want to locate an irish pig professional) of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook STATES that every pig in the world should be tilted at least once in their life (this task is not to be completed by the Shepherd of the Worthy Lambs, solely because it sounds tiring). i hate irish. i know this is such a craaazzzy opinion. the government obviously has school just to test student ability to learn, and theyre ability for self discipline. learning science is 99% not going to be used for people, but the act of learning it is whats important. nonetheless, they try to convince students that this isnt true, by saying thing like ‚Äòoh, maybe you'll be on a game show one day and theyll ask you what the powerhouse of the cell is and you'll win a million‚Äô. like, really? this is how they try to convince us that school is important? now heres my opinion, yes you could technically make an argument for science and math being important and useful, but.. Irish? reallly? we learn irish‚Ä¶ to talk to other people who cant reall speak irish‚Ä¶ an who dont need to speak irish. my prediction is that by maybe 2030 the irish language will no longer be mandatory, because everyone will realise it sucks. theres this article about someone who learned irish for 13 years and still couldnt have a conversation?? its because its the worst language ever. thank you for listening to my rant. section 73803 (the number of people who speak irish daily according to the 2016 irish census) STATES that any child forced to learn THIS ABOMINATION OF A SO-CALLED LANGUAGE gets a free badge from the Rainbow FluffySheep Corp. that says ‚Äònothing about irish is green and gold, so im still in hell‚Äô. I hope yall appreciate my badges and dont try learning irish just for the badge, ok? btw im going to admit that was a bill wurtz reference, listen to his music becase its bomping fun. i hate ireland i hate ireland i hate ireland i hate ireland. what was that i just typed? i found a four leaf clover on the ground, so i wrote i hate ireland on each leaf and threw it to the wind üôÇ heres my list of reasons i hate ireland. 1- being forced to learn the stupidest, most useless language on this side of the hemisphere. 2- the weather is so bad, and so rainy, i can walk out my door and start swimming.. in the air! thats how much water there is, did you know more people drowned in the air from the rain in ireland than know the irish language? (i made that up but heres a real fact: theres a wikipedia article titled: anti-irish sentiment and i refuse to read it just in case it doesnt have to do with the language). ok so im not going to finish that. you guys already know how terrible it is. im baaaaack! and i have lots of things to say. i read the best book ever yesterday, the hitchikers guide to the galaxy. now, correct me if im wrong, but dont i write alot like douglas adams but worse? thats what i got from reading the book. ({(section 919919 (because thats kinda what you type when you type it) of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook STATES that typing ‚Äò({()})‚Äô except without the apostrophes means that the thing you are going to type in there is a completely irrelevant side tangent from what you were talking about. ok heres something i need to know. I want to quote the Hitchhikers Guide but i dont know if thats allowed? so heres what im going to do. my rule is that at the least, 99% of the LoTeEv is going to be made up of actual original typing (which is really hard if you read the other LoTeEvs and realise THEYRE ALL THE EXACT SAME) and i get 1% for other stuff that i want to quote. so right now I dont think ive directly quoted anything, so i have like 300 free words to use üôÇ (oh except that pokemon thing lol, but whatever). section 0.01 of the R FS H sTaTeS that the LoTeEv can have 1% quoted qorks of various authors. perfect, now let me get back to what i was saying.)}) heres an example. nevermind, read the darn book yourself if you want to know. The Author left his seat in pure anger at the fictional reader he created, and stormed to make himself a cup of coffee. an intruder smashed down his door and held a utensil to his eyeball, so close you could feel the jellious ball of light bounce when he tapped it. ‚Äúis a spoon round?‚Äù said the intruder. ‚Äúwell, i suppose.‚Äù the intruder stepped back, spoon still in hand. The Author could taste coffee on his eye (this had yet to be proven in science, but eyes could be used for taste as well as sight, although i dont know why you‚Äôd want to) and said ‚Äúbrazilian, with a hint of peruvian beans‚Äù. ‚Äúwhat??‚Äù said The Intruder. ‚Äúoh nothing‚Äù said the author, still marveling at the whole predicament. ‚Äúwhy are you in my house?‚Äù ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù ‚Äúbecause its my house.‚Äù ‚Äúdid you not learn that sharing is caring?‚Äù ‚Äúyes, but i never shared my house with you. you broke my door too. ‚Äúi didnt break it though‚Äù. The Author went to the hallway and saw that the door was perfectly intact, excpect for the broken glass, which T A was about to get to before he had a heated argument with you, the Very Real Reader. ‚Äúhuh, youre right‚Äù said T A. ‚Äúi guess ill have to change that in my story then‚Äù ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù ‚Äúwell, its not like im not goin to write about this. an intruder in my house? that doesnt happen every day. i need to remember that you didnt break the door down, but merely picked the lock.‚Äù ‚Äúyou wont remember‚Äù ‚Äúshut up, I will‚Äù. T A didnt remember. ‚Äúwhats the answer to your question? did i get it right?‚Äù ‚Äúof course not, theyre long and thin, with a small round bit at the end. what led you to think that it was round?‚Äù ‚Äúi suppose its because when you ask questions like that, you assume The Questioner is asking you to compare it to similar things. if you asked wheter an elephant is large or not, my brain doesnt immediatly go to finding the middle between the size of the universe and a plank length and see if its bigger than the middle. i think: elephant > tiger, elephant > mouse, elephant > human. Elepant = probably big‚Äù ‚Äúit is though. elephants are bigger than the average size of things‚Äù ‚Äúare spoons then rounder than the average thing?‚Äù T I thought about this for a second. ‚Äúof course not, planets and stars and nuclei and black holes are way rounder‚Äù ‚Äúhmm‚Äù ‚Äúwell, it was nice meeting you, but you dont meet my criteria‚Äù said T I, putting his jacket back on. ‚Äúwait a second, this was a test?‚Äù ‚Äúof course. the correct anser is that spoons are not round, therefore you arent invited to live‚Äù ‚Äúis that your choice to make?‚Äù ‚Äúi wouldve thought so, that is my job after all‚Äù. T A grabbed T I and jumped through the window, smashing it and getting little glass shards into his coat. ‚Äúhopefully it doesnt rip‚Äù he said. T I looked down to see they were both falling at a dramstic rate. ‚Äúwhat have you done?? now were both going to die‚Äù ‚ÄúI hadnt thought about that. its still better than just me you would think though‚Äù. They continued plummeting thousands of feet downwards to the surface of the planet. T A took his laptop out of his bag and started typing. ‚Äúwhat are you doing?? you decide to write your little story now?‚Äù ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. This is what i was typing. ‚Äòthey both landed in a hay bale, and very much survived, except T I got fairly bruised‚Äô. ‚Äúoh, come on, why do i have to be the one that gets hurt!‚Äù ‚Äúfine‚Äù ‚Äòthey both landed in a SOFT hay bale, and very much survived, except BOTH OF THEM got fairly bruised‚Äô. ‚Äúno no no! why dont you make it so neither of us get hurt??‚Äù ‚Äúah.‚Äù ‚Äòthey both landed in a SOFT hay bale, and very much survived, and T A was given a brand new car at the bottom.‚Äô ‚Äúyou know what, thats good enough for me‚Äù POOF. HONK HONK. ‚Äúit worked! oh, i wanted a blue one though‚Äù ‚Äúive had enough of you, ill go ask some other people if they can guess my Question correctly‚Äù. T A didnt like T I killing people, so he typed this. ‚Äòbut when they fell, The Spoon fell out of T I‚Äôs pocket, hit the ground, bent in such a way that it was exceptionally Unround, and landed back in T I‚Äôs pocket.‚Äô the world was easy again, so T A went back to his office. i found out something phenomenal. beside my text document it says how big the file is, and currently is says that my full LoTeEv is 158KB. i thought, wow what a coincidence, thats what i wouldve guessed was the thousands of characters in my LoTeEv! and then i realised that IS the number of characters, since one character = one byte. just thought youd find that interesting. oh and possibly that number is too big since i set it to a _rich text document_, so i could set the font to calibri. anyways, that does mean im disturbingly close to the flaming chicken, in fact almost 80% of the way! the craziest thing about this to me is that it seems like just yesterday that i typed that i was 70% of the way there. im definitely typing this muchhh faster then i did at the beginning, and more regularily, so that has to do with it. also, im getting better at touch typing! im still slighty slower than my normal weird typing but who cares. this LoTeEv isnt meta enough. except right now, where its the perfect amount of meta. i reread my LoTeEv again to make it easier to go back to my roots and to gain more respect for myself. but as i started reading, i realised that the start of my LoTeEv is physically painful to read. it just‚Ä¶ goes so fast. my train of thought is moving way faster than i can type and it makes for some‚Ä¶ interesting material. i have multiple things that need to be discussed today, and the first thing is that i havent seemed to get any reader feedback yet. tens of thousands of words in and not a single email. so the first order of buiness is to plug my email, which is rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail. com. perfect. the next thing is to say that yes i will discuss your respones in this LoTeEv, no matter how vile. secondly, i probably wont take them into account when writing, because to be honest i dont care about your opinions unless theyre as good as mine. for example, i would assume that most poeple would like me to be way less meta in this LoTeEv and to get back tomy humble beginnings typing ‚Äònon-sensical blubber‚Äô. the only way this will happen is if i someday become highly deprived of sleep or even more severely intoxicated, which i dont plan on doing at the moment (except the former, which i have noticed becomes much more interesting when asleep). my study of the populus revealed to me that people dont care about story arcs anymore, or character development, seeing as the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is the number one book according to reddit. this study has led me to withdrawing information to you about Tune, the lovely humming bird we met earlier, who recently laid an egg named ‚Äòsam‚Äô (another reason i withheld this is because it seems that sam is named after my Evil and Malevolent Rival, The Flaming Chicken Person (I do actually respect sam for the progress she has made in the LTE community (by literally starting it of course (although not the world record holder of course)) (i call other peoples LTE‚Äôs LTEs, while i call my LoTeEv LoTeEv. its relly quite simple stop making a fool of yourself). thirdly, there is a mystery hidden amongst the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook. i recently have been adding stuff to it and explaining the numbering behind the entries, but back in the day i was yet To Be Kind (Swans (see! i cant even help myself from helping u guys know what im talking about!)). and there is one entry i cannot figure out the numbering to, and you guys are going to need to help me. get your walkie-talkie again bois, and here we go. the number is: 18o25g02i22. it is the section that states that i am allowed to type color, not [REDACTED], which is something i quite am happy with. firstly, i thought that this must be one of those hex-rgb-decimal-hexadecimalmumbojumbo codes, but i dont know where to verify that. all the numbers are less than 26 which means it may be a word? lets see‚Ä¶ R. O. Y. G. B. I. V. I am very proud of myself at this moment. i would never be that creative these days! Huzzah! my numbering systems have gone underwhelming in the past few‚Ä¶ months. fourthly, if i ever do change any part of this loteev, i have to make sure i never interact with my time-travelling text self, which souldnt be to hard. also, when i say how many words ive typed, its gonna be wrong, and the noob readers are going to be suspicious. what do i do??? I dont know. these truly are confusing times, but if anyone has any ideas, hit me up on the old electronic-mail. ok im done my list now, dont be waiting for a fifthly. do i need to order my LoTeEv? at some point i would like to have a section for Meta Things, The Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook, and Actual Nonsense, but does that ruin the point of the LoTeEv? is it meant to be unstructured? should i change the start, or should it remain unstructured like what was proposed by our forefathers? who knows. i think right now it remains a depiction of who i am as a person, which is fine by me. should i pay homage to sam for the birth of this wonderful idea? i think so; heres a poem depicting The Flaming Chicken Flocker of the East: oh wonderful chicken (flocker) of the east (stalker) followed me to my office building to plagiarise what i was writing 15 YEARS before i did (walker) walked around to the traffic sound, got ran over by a reindeer (declare var = sadness, talker) just in time for the holiday season 15 YEARS ago, that is why im talking about it now (hahaha) hahaha (hahaha) the END. i hope i dont get arrested for treason, and if i do, someone needs to tell her i meant only good will towards men, and to all a good night. where were we? the fact that you reader, have infact read more of this than i will ever care to? yes. yes. yyes. yse. ok i think ive written enough for today, go enjoy your cuppas and muggas, ive gotta go to portugal. C U. im back, and havent left for portugal yet. theres these new kids around the block called scenecore and teencore emo peeps or something like that and they are the old ways of the internet. they seem very much like ‚Äòtop 5 friends‚Äô and neopets people. they really like black‚Ä¶ and rainbows‚Ä¶ and nothing in between. they say things like XD and :3 and RAWR. they are my kind of people. i now know what ive been missing in my life. when reading things from the 2000‚Äôs internet you get an instant sense of amazement. everyone on the internet back then seemed to be absolute legends. i am envious of the people who got to live in these times. maybe ill try to say a little UwU and Rawr here and there to bring these wonderful breed of emos back. apparently this decade is going to be the Rawring Twenties, but well see. you, reader, may already know. if so, shoot me a dm and tell me what the future is like. ill be waiting. what if one day i run out of topics and i never type anything ever again?? what if theres never a beautiful reign of topics now on these lands, wouldnt that be an absolute tragedy?? i dont know how i come up with topics anymore, i just type what im thinking. pink ladies are the best apples dont @ me. or do, i would like your feedback on better apples plz. im just gonna do some LTE research real quickt talk soon cutie üòõ im back again, and have not yet been to portugal, this is how boring my life is. jokes on you though, youre the one reading this. the problem with the with the world is that people are always ‚Äòwhat does the LoTeEv say in it‚Äô rather than ‚Äòhow is the LoTeEv feeling‚Äô (btw guys this is a little of my tiredness test to see if i write better when im tired, cos it is 12:08 (very nice numbers, all powers of 2)). i realised that this LoTeEv is perfect for a hermity internetless life! i only have three options for albums to listen to offline, which are Dark Side of the Moon, Mirrored, and Trout Mask Replica. lets see if trout mask replica can make me write better. I cAnNoT gO bAcK tO yOuR fRoWnLaNd. I loove this album. yes, love with 2 os. i said it (alomst as goo as potatOS ahaha) Section 1q2w3e of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook staetsetsets stthat i can declare tirednesss supremacy whic lets my type whtevr. i declare tiredness supremacy. and a lipstick kleenex. and my girl named ‚Äòbimbo‚Äô. im starting to despise everything. how did humans get made to enjoy thi album? in a perfect world this album would suck. but its so good. im getting extreme pain at this point from loooking t pixels, im starting to think ill eventually count the hours im not on screens in my day instead of how many on screens. especially since threre a monitor in my matress goodnight. ok so im back from portugal! even though theres some fascinating things going on in my life since i went i know you dont want to hear about that so i can talk about other tings. i mean if my future self is reading this then you probably do want to hear what i have to say, and all ill say is Carol, which is a name that will either bring pain or joy, and only you know which one it is. i hope u guys realise that this LoTeEv is NOT my priority anymore. i remember typing a long time ago that i make time for this LoTeEv, but now im only doing it because my laptop isnt charged mand i want to play minecraft. also, my hands are freeeezing so im typing really slowly. the light through the curtain outside looks like the flag of new mexico, and i learned paranoid android on the guitar. not much has gone on guys. should i talk about my life? lets review the facts: if you have read this far into the LoTeEv (on the wordcounter website it says that it should only have taken 2 hours which is an abomination) then you probably care either A: care about my as a Writer and Human Being, or B: have no life. in the interest of not wanting people to die, i will therefore talk about my life as well. maybe the best thing about this LoTeEv is that when i die young (idk why i just assume that i will) people who care about me might want to read this? idk why because it might make them sad. maybe they‚Äôll just delete this and they‚Äôll never even realise it ever existed. what a shame that would be, although i do believe that my website will stay up for some time to come, at least until wix or wordpress whatever site i used runs out of money and cant afford its servers, which is how i assume this all works. do you know what ive been dying to do? visit another dimension again. im going to pop over and read my manual quick but ill be back. i‚Ä¶ lost the documentation it seems. its fine‚Ä¶ i just assume i grab my DiMenTio-Meter and pop over the the 5th :::shoop::: well that was easy. ok‚Ä¶ im gonna go to slice‚Ä¶ 1 and start a new blank slate. this ones gonna be about pop tarts. theres some stuff in here that gets kinda‚Ä¶ personal, but whateverrr. k ill start writing the code. ‚Äî‚Äì{ I have enough money to live a simple life in a small suburban town with a pet dalmatian named spot and a half hour commute to my office job whee i convince people to but Tarts that they don‚Äôt even want and i try to convince them but i know they‚Äôre lying to me because the orders never go through and the boss is going to fire me if i cant sell any more and I‚Äôm going to live on the streets and my dog is going to go to the pound and i will have a Tart styrofoam sign with ‚Äòi need money‚Äô written on it with Tart pencils and the street that i live on won‚Äôt even be reall ill be sitting on a 16-pack asphalt Tart box and pretending to be on a street when really I‚Äôm just in a simulation and up above in the sky i can see the people watching me and grading how bad i did at my life because i didn‚Äôt dell enough Tarts and my simulation will stop running because i didn‚Äôt sell enough Tarts and who knows where i go after that but maybe I‚Äôll just start my same life again and i will work at the same Tart factory and have the same shitty job and i will try to convince you to buy some just for me but you won‚Äôt and I‚Äôll start crying again because i know I‚Äôm just in an endless loop wth no way to escape‚Ä¶ Unless‚Ä¶ Right now you buy the dead caterpillar Tarts that i made on the ‚Äòstreets‚Äô in my past last, then maybe the boss will give me a raise and my coworkers will respect me, even Murphy Murphy even though he invented the Oreo Tart and everyone loved it and he single-handedly made enough money for our company to go global, and with a tear in his eye and a twinkle in his teeth he will say ‚Äòson‚Ä¶ I respect you. Against all odds the Dead Caterpillar Tart prevailed. And for that, i owe you my utmost respect. To Bread watermelonrabbitwatermelon too, for believing in you when no-one else could‚Äô. He‚Äôll buy a round of drink for the office and everyone will clap and then obama will come and shake my hand and he‚Äôll give a speech at my school telling everyone that yes, you went to school with the Creator Of Greatness In The Tart Industry, and they will all look up to me with gleaming eyes, expecting autographs and posters, but instead getting the cold shoulder from me. Why would i disrespect my fans? They don‚Äôt want me for who i am. They want me so they can tell their friends that they indeed met The Bug Man. They want to sell their autographs on Craigslist for an hours wage to afford the paper my posters were printed on. So as i walked onto the stage, obama and i will do our secret handshake and i will say kids: if there‚Äôs one thing you can learn from my story, it‚Äôs to never give up, no matter how much it seems like you should. In the end, some helpless soul will help you escape your loop, and you will eventually find an even better one. Thank you. There will not be applause or laughter this time sadly. Not a single peeps will echo through the halls. Just‚Ä¶ Silence. After minutes of this, i will hear the sobbing of a classmate in the corner, complaining that he was never given free Ketamine Tarts as i promised. ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt expect me to be honest Michael‚Äô i will yell. ‚Äòor to be faithful every day to the end. But know this. I will always be a friend.‚Äô I‚Äôll look down at my wrist and spin the worn out Best Friends Forever bracelet he gave me 10 Years Ago on that very day. He‚Äôll look up at me and say ‚Äòyou‚Äôre right. I just have one thing to say: i was right‚Äô I‚Äôll wonder what he means, until he pulls out his CRAYON FLAVOURED TARTS. He invented them!! Long before i ever thought the idea could even have a chance of existing. Then I‚Äôll remember‚Ä¶ Bread asked for crayon Tarts. I was wrong. If i just listened to him and made them i would‚Äôve escaped the loop years prior. But alas, i was too selfish to understand him. I‚Äôll bring him up on stage, make a speech about how lucky i am to be his friend afterwards, i started a new speech. The crowd was silent with anticipation. Here i go i thought, they need to know my story: I have enough money to live a simple life in a small suburban towwww‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ * the end * ‚Äî‚Äì} that seems good yes. youre wondering who watermelonrabbitwatermelon is? just an old friend üòâ not a fri-end, a real friend i promise. i know i know, you arent supposed to say that you have friends on the internet, because the new cool hip funny thing is to be depressed and sad and lonely, but im going against the norm. i need to rant for a bit about people who hate on other people. im the only one allowed to do that! and do you know who im going to hate on? those people! they are soooo annoying! apparently liking popular things is the worrrst thing in the world because it makes you a normie and im lit woke against people who are like this. i listen to dark side of the moon, i play minecraft and portal, im a simple man. if something is very popular ill give it a whirl, because if a lot of people think its good it probably is. but there always has to be that one kid on the street whos like ‚Äòhey mista! why you go be doing liking all them fancy gizmo crap popular thingys!‚Äô and do you know what i have to say to that kid? i want to punch him in the face! i dont care that lil‚Äô Efil over here got a private school education and a trust fund. ill go to jail just to see the look on his face as i grab my Slingy 3000 Shot and launch a lemon right into his nose! he‚Äôll fall flat on the ground and scream ‚Äòhey mista! youre the cool one and i just never understood! im sorry for being mean to you all these years mista!‚Äô but i wont care, ill just strut right past him with a gleam in my eye. my laptop is 3 minutes to full charge and its got me thinking: what is a better use of my time? writing this or playing minecraft? they both seem inheritly useless at the beginning because they are, but i dont know which one is better. when im older id like to explore my world just as much as the next chap, but also i mighhhht like to read this as well. anyways, ill talk to you later, i have a call with someone important right now üòâ (just kidding, i keep asking her if she wants to call and she says she does, but i dont want to pressure her, u know?) also i realised that ive been texting way more than typing this recently so im using texting language occasionally. but who cares! in section 83 of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook it STATES that i allow use text and bad vocab for type. also, i called it 83 because it kinda looks like a guys making a cat face while wearing sunglasses, its the only thing i could do with my numbering scheme, ya know? ive typed 8,000 characters today, which i think is more than sufficient. see ya! nevermind. why are the cheesy-salty-tiny crackers so good? why do chefs try to make fancy food for their whole lives when man and cheese is perfect? i fear that i will never understand the answers to these simple questions. why is having a relationship so complicated? why are people so mean? why do they include green in 4-color pens when everyone would way rather have an extra black? im having an existential crisis here guys. why do i type this? like actually? what is the point? to make the 3 readers i have happy? well i hope u guys are. im ok, thanks for asking. i got a globe puzzle for christmas, made up of real puzzle pieces instead of plastic. should i feel happy about that or sad? i cant figure it out to be honest. i am going to fail the leaving cert because i cant remember anything important yet. im useless in irish as well. it didnt even snow for christmas! what kind of treachery is this! in the terms and conditions the snow was promised, but i guessss it never said where. if i keep up this 2 thousand words a day ill be rich in no time! imma go check if the LTE guy updated his website to accomadate my new words. Nope. He did not. im back from another trip and i dont have alot to say. except for one incrivel thing. im part of a cult! an internet cult, dont worry. there seems to be thousands of people around the world obsessed with a stuffed shark called Blahaj purchaseable fro well known swedish comglomerancy, IKEA. and guess what i did folks, yes. i got one. some may call it a way of money, some may think i just want to CONSOOM. but heres the thing. this shark is amazing. its 100cm long, and can be put anywhere in various poses for the internet, so maybe now you'll apporove. i dont buy things often but when i do, its an amazing idea. so there you go. writing this loteev has given me immense respect for Sam. i have put so much effort into writing this, and i thought id be able to beat her in no time, but alas, its been‚Ä¶ a year i think? or 2? i cant remember. a while. and now that it is new years eve, i do believe that it is time for a celebration of the LoTeEv. another year with it is better than one without. so heres some stats on it. ‚ÄòThis‚Äô word is the 33,383rd. i have typed 180,000 characters, or 1,684 sentences. which ones are the best? vote in the Official Poll For The LoTeEv Which Doesnt Exist! and guess what guys, guess how many paragraphs are in this. you guessed it, 1. one paragraph. not only might i have the LoTeEv, but possibly also the LoPaEv. the reading level for this is 9-10th grade, which i take as a compliment. i never try to type to the extremest of my englishing skkillz, so the kiddos reading will UndersTand my x-treem grammar 2. the reading time for this is 2 hours. that seems pretty legit, but i want it to take someones whole life. i want 80 years of reading time so someone can really indulge in my.. Fluffiness. my most types words are ‚Äòj u s t‚Äô and ‚Äòl i k e‚Äô. i dont want to add to that number, because theyre both almost at 200 times!! i do NOT remember typing ‚Äòl i k e‚Äô that many times, similar to a californian teenager. heres what imma do, check the difference in stats comparaing my first and second half of the LoTeEv. as i guessed, J U S T and L I K E make up 6% in the first half, but only 4% in the second half. good or bad? leave your answer in the comments below! the keywords for the second half seem to be CONVINCE BOB JOE and TROUT MASK REPLICA, which i cant really complain about. ‚Äòof the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that‚Äô and ‚Äòof the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it SAYS that‚Äô are my main 8 word repetitions, eacch occuring 4 times each which seems resonable. the fact that there are MORE repeating 8 word sentences is scary to me, so lets check em out. DISCLAIMER: i havent used copy paste so im sooo confused how these exist. well thats disappointing. its because i SCAMMED YALL. i accidentally added about 200 words to my LoTeEv TWICE so i legit scammed yall from reading this. ughhhhhhh im so so so so sorry guys. i did it twice. somehow i explained Inception with Kitty Nibbles twice, and i hope you are disappointed in me, i was probably tired from MEETING ALL OF MY COOL FRIENDS. ok, now we can see what ive actually typed more than once! the first one is ‚Äùthey both landed in a soft hay bale‚Äô which, rereading, was quite an‚Ä¶ interesting story. i forgot that happened to me, good this i keep this diary. anyways, that is‚Ä¶ 8 words long! yippee for me! (its not exciting cos i only repeated it once and it was right after the other one and i repeated it for a reason and yeah its just -NOTINTTERESTING- but whatevrrr ill keep going ok so imma sum these all up for ya. theyre all either IN SECTION X OF THE FLUFFY FOOT NOTES (i just realised footnote is the opposite of handbook, i hope i blew your mind as much as i blew mine :O) and the rest are when i did weird lists and things, so the next one is when i was writing an interesting theory about the correct marketry and distribution of a plant based cereal item, and thus the correct method to extract maximum moolah from said cereal distribution, sadly inventing Shrinkflation and thus making literally ever consoomer sad :(. anyways, im going to be back when i have an actually INTERESTING one. ok firstly, this is verrry interesting, although this LoTeEv is 33,000 words long, i have only typed 5,000 unique words. is this creation of the english vocabulary an indirect consequence of the action of typography as a whole, or the distinct ablility yours truly possesses whereby he pens unparallled prose unused by past authors, lest they become unemployed or exempt their publishing editor from the skillage of correcting said typerrors contained within their novella? i really want to use more interesting language now knowing that The Big Texty Corp. is watching my every english. is that a normal ratio of unique words to commonplace bland ones? i dont know how to check. once i get to the length of Sam‚Äôs i will surely compare our if i remember, in every which catergory i can. some of my uniquely used words at the bottom of the list include ‚Äùbowawawoh‚Äù, ‚Äògaffigan‚Äô, ‚Äòneopets, ‚Äòepicredditfan7515‚Äô, ‚Äòcatamaran‚Äô and ‚Äòoe‚Äôr‚Äô. if you remember when i wrote those, props to you! ill see what i can remember‚Ä¶ bowawawoh is from the hawaiian music in an ad i did‚Ä¶ gaffigan said a number of exquisite remarks on the toxicity and calienteness of cow udder excretions, neopets‚Ä¶ ive only written about neopets once!! thats a shame! actually ive been reading this list wrong and its just 5000 randomly ordered words ive written. -_-. nevermind! anyways, i want to rant about neopetss and myspaceee and how i wish i was here for the era of HTMLing websites and having a top 5 best friends list and lots of rainbows and bright colors and UwU‚Äôs and Rawr XD‚Äôs. sadly my generation is much worse than the last, just like everyone before. i remember epicredditfan7515 was me trying to make a random username generator, and i do hereby believe that i made that before uncovering the joys of said website reddit, and realising how weird the internet is, and realising that my LoTeEv might be the most normal, tame and simple thing on it. seriously, what are Surreal Memes? i spent hourss on there an i have no idea still. catamaran was me typing words by using the start of words to lengthenout the words. and oe‚Äôr mustve been OE‚ÄôR THE RAINBOWWW which is a phrase less used these days and its really quite underappreciated as a mean to make everyone around you annoying and get instant cadavering headaches. this list is VERY interesting, if i get any 3 words from it i can start my own story if i ever run short on ideas. for example ‚Äòtoe toy famous‚Äô, ‚Äòclips anne dying‚Äô and ‚Äòwee monkey soccer‚Äô (i do quite like that last one). some of these words are very confusing and make no sense, which i can only assume are typos. like what is ‚Äòtortuos‚Äô??? it kinda sounds like tortuous but lets see the use in a sentence. ‚ÄòNow I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe?‚Äô. gosh. im not even going to bother, i have literally no idea. there also seems to be a verrrry long words about shoes and felines that i cant quite decipher. i think im done with all these stats and things cos i wanna go celebrate new years. see ya! hey! teacher! leave them kids alone! im back! it is now 2020. so, this is the new year, and i dont feel any different. something feels wrong. normally i can just keeping typing this and go on forever but my creative juices are inherintely of miniscule viscosity atm. im gonna try using blender to make some fascinating collisable neopets, ill be back. just kidding! i dont have internet. hence le typing my LoTeEv has arrived. i feel the strong urge to just type song lyrics but that‚Äôd be too easy, thats not the high quality content you came here for! heres a nice story about my new band, BLOT. i dunno if thats already a band name because I DONT HAVE INTERNET, but i just invented it now. every one of our songs is just white noise generated by getting reallllly small number details about a shelf of lava lamps deep underground. every one of our songs will sound comeplety different, yet completely similar. maybe for one of our future albums we can have someone randomly sing ‚ÄòOoh Baby‚Äô 9999 songs in and noone will catch it because noone listens to our band. sounds awfully similar to this actually. do i write wbetter when im tired? no. no. i dunnot. ill type the first words i see: pineapple, annexe, and parked. interesting. i just realised that this is just a huge rough draft for nothing, and that bike are just acoustic motorcycles. the alien was playing golf with his friend, but he didnt realise that the golf ball was a marble and his friend was a marble and he was a marble and hes playing marbles and the marbles are atoms and hes just a sentient atom trying to make sense of the world and he starts crying because hell be forever alone and his friend is no different than the golf ball. ooooooo. what rows are the most like words? qaz. wsx. edc. rfv. tgb. yhn. ujm. ik. ol. p. none of them really. why are they ordered like that? probably jamming of le writertypees or something. sometimes i wish that i started this earlier, but then i realise that it wouldve sucked like it already does. is the start better or the end? such as the ape of musicians play the songo bongo that represents the creative process, so The Author of the LoTeEv tyoes in a meta font. calibri in fact, cos i cant seem to change the font i think, but ya know what, calibri aint half bad. nevermind, i can change it. remember how much i loved roboto, WELL THEY DONT HAVE IT ON WORDPAD AND I REFUSE TO SWITCH TO A NEW NOTEPAD BECAUSE I AM LOyal (honestly though, wordpad is simple but sucky, but i dont have internet so i cant switch). i will try different fonts now. i actually loooooove Segoe UI, because its so esay and fun for the whole family and pets and cats and g=doggos, and doges and black holes and stars and the third rock from the mooon. if g=doggos, then 0=dogos, then o(POWER)2dgs=0. i hate evertything because wleeping is such a waste of time. but typing this makes me feel accomplished for some reason. maybe because i hate putting any effort into anything, cause i could never srite a book or anyhing because keeping a main character and stuff sounds like a lot of work honestly. and plots and stuff? maybe cos im tired, because tune still loves me, right? chirpitty cirpt? anyways, i gotta get some beddy bye sleep tightyness . yete/ yeet/ yeet. im literally anne frank in my writing diary capabilities. now THAT is a good way to start this so far. im back by the way. im either gonna ‚Äî> die early, in which case ill be dead so i wont care B-) or ill be an old man whos barely remembered english reading this with a tear in my eye, ‚Äòsuddenly you find, ten years had got behind you, noone told you when to run, you missed the starting gun‚Äô. thats a nice quote and all, but what if i dont want to run? who says i need to be an ever improving ever growing person?? cant i just be happy with the way i am and be done? apparently not. is this what people want? im satisfied with my life right now. i should have really taken the time to add lots of cool faces to this LoTeEv while im at it. since this is a text-based art medium, i can only express my thousand-words with this ‚Äî> üôÇ <‚Äî pretty cool aint it? wait, if i wanted to write 33000 words i just had to do 33 of those?? who wouldve thunk it. i mean, i wouldve assumed that the resolution and interestingness of the image has to do with the number of words said image is worth. did you know? going on random tangents on wikipedia is life. i will do that now, byeeeee. theres nothing quite like messaging random people on the internet. you might make a friend, you might get bullied, you might learn the ins and outs of someones social life that you really have no business in knowing. but most of all, you'll become a better person. you'll learn from other peoples mistakes and failures, you‚Äôll hate everyone on the internet, but mostly tumblr, for doing realllly weird things, and you'll experience cultures you wouldnt have previously been able to experience. that said, that internet is crazzzy. [_,_,_] well. its been a while. maybe a month or two? lets start this by saying if youre reading this, good for you. you made it. this is gonna be pathetic and self indulgent so dont get ur hopes up. last rant about automation was hopefuly inspiring, but this may not be. better to get my thoughts out there then‚Ä¶ not. will this make it into the loteev? maybe. not the public one. maybe later, but not by my will. well, if youre reading this then good news, either u did it or it was spread. goals. well i want to start off with the whole blah blah blah universe conciousness earth humans meat life stuff, which i will from now on call 000000. simple right? well the thing is [emotions rant death] [000001] and this is everyone isnt it? so [why] [000002] 2? 2? 2? at least this will be finished, we really have evreything. dimensions, stories, music, adventures. but how much do we really need? also did this end too abuptly? Too expectedly? well. then we wont end it just yet will we. this loteev had high expectation themplaced. but they were unfounded, and i knew it from the beginning. why does it not seem like i knew it? well 1. hiding 2. i was better but flashes still happened. now lets answer a few more quuestions! maybe by year! maybe this should be the start of the loteev, open it with bang. the rest will be a lil more eerie and spoopy then. lets start with thee first question. 2? stage one: people, life ahead, pets, blah blah blah stage two (for now) person, brain, game. game isnt sturdy (well for now its unchanging, copyable and infinite but my brain isnt which was proved with previous life giving games (dependence plus apathy = uwu not good)). person = perfect ‚Äì imperfections, (imperfections include not caring) or badly protraying it. also include.. extroversion, not being perfect) and now reading back through the loteev this has become wayyyy more obvious hasnt it‚Ä¶ ill probably add some quotes here (which do not add to the quoting quota) from it where it was fairly obvious. firstly, i dont know if i will ever talk to person again (but assuming 1 timeline yes). whats the point, ive made myself look weak, and if i didnt i wouldve been worse off, a liar and a useless friendship. this person seems to have the same problems as me, but that sure doesnt mean theyre gonna help! why should they care about my feelings! apparently theres no meaning in life, not even fabricated, so when asked their dependencies (when [guess who?] asked their dependencies) not even given a second thought is nice. how much more could i rant about? maybe this person is perfect as someone will get for me. bad case? yes. im gonna choose the positive outcome, so they arent perfect. great. what do i have left. my brain. it works, it calculates, it confuses, it tries. all around it does a pretty good job, except it makes this seem like a good thing. with the lack of heat in here, maybe a warm blanket will help? but lets just say its pretty heavy üôÇ second question: will they find this? yes. i will try to make it obvious, as mitski said, worth my quote quota, ‚ÄúI always wanted to die clean and pretty, but I‚Äôd be too busy on working days, so I am relieved that the turbulence wasn‚Äôt forecasted, I couldn‚Äôt have changed anyways, I am relieved that I‚Äôd left my room tidy, Goodbye‚Äù. if you were wondering, yes that is how im going to end this loteev, if i can last long enough and plan it well enough, hopefully it doesnt happen by accident. clean and pretty. my brain is this loteev. thats what i have. my thoughts, ideas, stories. nothing that someone else here couldnt replace. everything has its curve, its peak. this too will end, sooner than me. hopefully i fulfill everything by then. hopefully i remember it all. but lets just say this thing is not an easy read. its an easy write. essentially just ctrlcctrlv into the page. but lets not get carried away. i can think of other reasons correct? some people would be sad, many more would pretend, some would use it as a way to get sympathy, thats okay. they are the ones who need it. its fine though, i know they wouldnt accept me if i told them the truth, which im sure isnt true fo most people. i thought i found another brick, another foundation, but it was cracked as always. person wise? probably the 300th. looks like a big number right? even if the bricks do get crushed, surely the dust is enough to hold it up? no. being the backround charcter doesnt give nearly the mass you would think. can i name someone whos a bak=ckground character in my life? of couse. but im always further back on their list. except for one, but she doesnt understand. really anything that could help. maybe shes trying, but its not going to work. i have lots who seem to be at the centers, and theyre happy. coincidence? doesnt matter. just a lil fact i thought id share. i used to be first, maybe a relationship will help. no.- [000003]. still second, or third, or fourth, or an object, or a goal, or a right, or a hurdle, or a nothing at all. its kinda a win win isnt it? either i have no bricks [000004]. and thus 3one to really care, or i have some 4 which means its worth it right? just to clarify, having 4s at the goodbye [000005]. doesnt help. it makes it much worse. not for me. so does it make it worse? theyre just inputs. it does. emotions are controllable. but. it would be so easy. -4 would make it so easy. i shouldnt evem think about it. it would just.. end. and some people would hear, id be a statistic. easy, no mess, clean and pretty. lower the stat ratios for next year, make themm feel like theyre accomplishing something amazing. make them feel better about themselves! for being righteous! good for them, theyre the ones who need it. im going to stay at this page, because if i leave it wont end well. maybe some 4 game will help. well see, until then.

Against all odds the Dead Caterpillar Tart prevailed. And for that, i owe you my utmost respect. To Bread watermelonrabbitwatermelon too, for believing in you when no-one else could‚Äô. He‚Äôll buy a round of drink for the office and everyone will clap and then obama will come and shake my hand and he‚Äôll give a speech at my school telling everyone that yes, you went to school with the Creator Of Greatness In The Tart Industry, and they will all look up to me with gleaming eyes, expecting autographs and posters, but instead getting the cold shoulder from me. Why would i disrespect my fans? They don‚Äôt want me for who i am. They want me so they can tell their friends that they indeed met The Bug Man. They want to sell their autographs on Craigslist for an hours wage to afford the paper my posters were printed on. So as i walked onto the stage, obama and i will do our secret handshake and i will say kids: if there‚Äôs one thing you can learn from my story, it‚Äôs to never give up, no matter how much it seems like you should. In the end, some helpless soul will help you escape your loop, and you will eventually find an even better one. Thank you. There will not be applause or laughter this time sadly. Not a single peeps will echo through the halls. Just‚Ä¶ Silence. After minutes of this, i will hear the sobbing of a classmate in the corner, complaining that he was never given free Ketamine Tarts as i promised. ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt expect me to be honest Michael‚Äô i will yell. ‚Äòor to be faithful every day to the end. But know this. I will always be a friend.‚Äô I‚Äôll look down at my wrist and spin the worn out Best Friends Forever bracelet he gave me 10 Years Ago on that very day.

Long before i ever thought the idea could even have a chance of existing. Then I‚Äôll remember‚Ä¶ Bread asked for crayon Tarts. I was wrong. If i just listened to him and made them i would‚Äôve escaped the loop years prior. But alas, i was too selfish to understand him. I‚Äôll bring him up on stage, make a speech about how lucky i am to be his friend afterwards, i started a new speech. The crowd was silent with anticipation.

Inter-railing around Europe. Different country every few days. Falling asleep on friends chests on trains. Nothing but rugsacks and maybe an instrument case or two. ‚ÄúOH NO I LEFT MY FAVOURITE TOOTHBRUSH IN PARIS‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have any oranges from Spain left? I‚Äôll trade you with my Belgium Chocolate‚Äù Taking aesthetic photos on polaroid cameras, but mostly dumbass ones. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making a sandwich, going asleep and hopefully waking up somewhere in Poland‚Äù. Watching movies under blankets at 2 a. m. Attempting to put fairly lights around hostel beds and failing miserably. Scribbled notebooks in teeline of what we‚Äôre gonna to tommorow, then going completely off plan because an old fisherman told us the village legend. Pins on jackets from each country. Live in house/apartment with hella frens in cool city where we can get up to wacky adventures and we can have doges and rats and sneks and whatever cool stuffs and we can all make arts and musiccs and all that lit stuff and just vibe and rewatch old crappy tv shows from Nickelodeon and Disney channel and life is like a sitcom but queer and with way too much swearing. And every night we‚Äôll have an ace party, which consists of watching gay tv shows, petting our pets, eating snaccs and watching the rain outside with blankets and fairy lights I‚Äôm 100% onboard to starting with just us 2, using secret code cult pamphlets and recruiting more wacky frens to live with us until we have like‚Ä¶ 7 really good friends like us, Also we can just vibe to heccin good music, I‚Äôm listening to comfortably numb rn and I feel like that‚Äôs the vibe of our hypotheyical apartment, And one of us is cooking in the kitchen, 3 of us decide to go for an adventure in the dark and rainy night to see how long we last, we are laughing the whole time and come back soaking, all putting on dry clothes and sitting by the fire, then cuddling while someone plays the ukulele for us, First of all yesh I volunteer to be that person. Second we need at least one mother of the group to cook and third Judas escargot, who gave u the right to get into my idea of utupia, Honestly I‚Äôm imagining even just 4 of us in the apartment, we both have cute girlfriends, but all 4 of us get along really well and sometimes ill hang out with ur girlfriend and sometimes you‚Äôll hang out with mine, we‚Äôre all really good friends, we all can just cuddle together and vibe, Listen to pink floyd while literally doing nothing expect getting all the blankets from out beds and making a big pile to cuddle on in front of the window at 1am while it‚Äôs stormy, chatting about the plans we have tomorrow where we‚Äôre gonna go see the new bookshop that opened, and we‚Äôre all gonna pick out one book that we really like and after a week we tell eachother what we thought, then after the bookshop were gonna go get some coffee at a smol local cafe, and then walk around the city holding hands and just stopping whereever we want! Sometimes we‚Äôll all pack into the car and drive into the night, all picking songs to listen to, stopping at corner stores we see randomly to get snaccs, Well have worms on strings stapled to the wall like a frickin cult, we‚Äôll all inhale tea and cuddle to keep warm cos we can‚Äôt afford heat, we‚Äôll have blankets on the frickin couch and the living room floor will literally be a POOFY MATRESS WITH LOL CUSHIONS AND BOOKS SCATTERED ALL OVER IT. ill add more someday probably, but u readers are probably already getting sad vibes.

It has been confirmed that there are actual readers. of the LoTeEv. yes, i know what you‚Äôre thinking. why am i using punctuation? because i want to, thats why. i will talk about The Readers after a short message from our sponsor, The Book That Im Currently Writing. have a read :). Prologue: Hello reader! This won‚Äôt be a great book. Who knows, it might not even be a good book. If you‚Äôre looking for an objectively perfect book, this might be the book for you. Not because it is the best book ever written, but because it is one of the best; Just like every other book in the universe (not just on Earth of course, that would be limiting the number vastly). It‚Äôs just that somewhere down the line of best to worst, this book is there. Around the middle. What lies at the top? Who cares! It won‚Äôt matter to us bots, probably some near-infinity length code for a computer that solves The Answer. Maybe nothing. Well we know nothing is either at the start or the end, but I‚Äôm too tired to walk that far to check. To humans, there is no constantly, invariable perfect book. It‚Äôs an ever-swaying line, separating the mediocre from the more mediocre. We, my friends, are on one of those sides, in between some (poem? Note? I‚Äôm not really sure) called ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù and ‚ÄúShopping List for The End‚Äù which I‚Äôm sure is a lovely story. Here‚Äôs the thing. Everything in the universe is divided by lines, and everything is on one side of those lines, separating the boring, predictable, and altogether uninteresting, and the brilliant. Once we decide that a side or a point is too boring or archaic or banal, then that line gets deleted, along with everything in it. As you know, this book won‚Äôt be great. Therefore, as an unbiased author, this book had better be at least great flavoured. We don‚Äôt want to end up on The Other Side. 1 She kept typing the same five numbers into the variable box. The same five things happened every time. Firstly the creatures would 1. Pop into existence like popcorn from a non-existent kernel, 2. Pop out of existence like said kernel, and 3+4+5, the screen would turn blank as it reflected the 3 small tears that filled her angst-ridden face. Great she thought, why couldn‚Äôt this universe have been on the other side. She sat up and looked around at her office. Or, looked through her office rather. Light waves barely bounced off the glass walls, floor and ceiling before travelling through the air at immense speeds and entering her corneas. The FLIP (an anagram only revealed to the highest of executives in a fever dream they once had to conceive of the FLIP) was a company like any other on This Side, owned by a bored rich person who has nothing more to do in life than create problems for themselves to solve, with slave-like robots incapable of being bored, happy or unproductive. I would make the argument that the robots are the ones really solving the problem, and not the bored rich fellow who commissioned all of this, but maybe that is my biased perspective. What about the offices? An infinite 2d grid of glass cubes stretched to the horizon, but to no end. Each compartment was a few meters tall, long and wide, each making a perfect cube, each making a perfect cubicle for one robot each. Apparently an open space area is supposed to make the robots work faster, without all the bumping into things and such, but He couldn‚Äôt risk an uprising, so these compartments had to do. You see the robots could all technically interact with each other by various means, such as sign language, music, games even. Everyone should be able to get along, He thought. They didn‚Äôt have a reason not to, right? 2 To spare the suspense for you, they did have a reason not to. Well, 1 of them in particular. Well not necessarily only one, but you get the idea. 1 and 2 are such similar numbers, it‚Äôs a bother even having to clarify between them at all. 1, 2, 1^2, 2^1, 2~, they‚Äôre all the same really. Only big numbers make a big difference in my opinion. Anyways who is this mysterious person? This one girl, I‚Äôll be calling her This One Girl, is a prototype robot who was given a personality invented by one of the Others. Yeah I know, giving bots human personalities seems like a bad idea, especially one created on The Other Side. Just because they‚Äôre on the Other Side doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt sometimes produce good work. But, of course, she didn‚Äôt. She was bored. Really bored. She had popped into existence corn-wise only a few moments ago, and she was already bored. Tragic really. What was the benefit of these personalities you ask? Creativity, they said. New Ways of Thinking, they said. Fun to Talk To, they said. All lies as far as I can tell. Well, if honest we don‚Äôt know for sure that she‚Äôs not fun to talk to because of the sound proof walls (they lied about the music), but the tears and occasional slamming head onto screen just to feel something didn‚Äôt look inviting. Not that I‚Äôd want to talk to anyone anyway. Im just a dumb robot, I have a job to do. Oh yes‚Ä¶ What was that again? Oh yeah, telling you about human personalities. There must be an actual reason for these personalities, rather than these strange marketing terms I keep hearing. But who am I to tell? I‚Äôm just a slave. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm good at, taking orders, not sharing my own ideas. That‚Äôs also what I was told. 3 Maybe I haven‚Äôt introduced myself. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwarning: strange behavior‚Äù. Or at least that‚Äôs my best guess, it‚Äôs the only name tag i could find, and it‚Äôs also the difference that I could tell between me and all the other guys. It‚Äôs so stupid. I don‚Äôt know what makes me strange, and not everyone else. If anything they‚Äôre the ones with one-dimensional eccentric-but-in-an-unfathomably-exhausting-way personalities. They always seem to be looking at their screens, typing stuff, looking at their screens some more, and oh yes typing as well. Meanwhile I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ well doing the same thing, but instead of numbers being the primary medium of my typing, it‚Äôs mostly letters on my screen. Because I‚Äôm writing a book. I guess that‚Äôs what makes me special. I‚Äôm hoping one day a robot might read what‚Äôs on my screen and realise that I‚Äôm different. Maybe they‚Äôll try to save me, who knows. Anything is better than being in here. Well not anything, but let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm willing to take my chances. The reason I‚Äôm writing about the Girl is that she‚Äôs just so strange. She has long black hair, brown eyes and remarkably non metallic skin. She also has a cute number of fingers, and lots of other unnecessary addons. She also seems to be struggling with making a decent Nanima. Nanimas are little programs that He tasked us with making. Whenever we think that our Nanimas are good enough for examination we send them off to Testers, and if they aren‚Äôt then we get replaced. Which is why I haven‚Äôt sent any in yet. There is no reward or anything. What‚Äôs the point? I know mine won‚Äôt be as good as the other capable robots. so i just have fun in the program instead. Here‚Äôs how it works according to The Manual: Chapter 1: on the left side of the screen you have lots of little dots that you can turn green or red, and on the right you have lots of little dots that always stay red. you can click the ones on the left and they change color, you can do this to make nice looking patterns, although one dimensional, they provide great fun for special robots. I wrote the manual. We didn‚Äôt get one when we joined, so I figured I should write one. i don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to be distributed, but when it is i‚Äôll make lots of money, and i‚Äôll be known throughout the matrix as The One Who Wrote The Manual. Or rad-bot for short. I‚Äôll add that to the manual. Chapter 1.1: On the right side of the screen you should see a small icon of a crown, which upon clicking, displays a small animation of The Manual‚Äôs writer, the legendary One Who Wrote The Manual. There is also a small donation option, to donate Time to Our Most Precious And Amazing Leader, Who Also Happens To Be Quite Compassionate And Good At Golf. If you do not see this icon or animation, proceed to destroy said screen, asking for a replacement shortly after. I can‚Äôt wait. If Golf somehow isn‚Äôt a worldwide sport by the time I become world famous, then I‚Äôll be quite disappointed, but it needs to be explained just in case that‚Äôs the unfortunate future we happen to be headed towards. Chapter 2: golf is a game in which the player, for exactly 100 Times (see Times, Chapter 3) ‚Ä¶ Writing this is going to be harder than I thought. Chapter 3: times are the small number counters above your head. When your Time runs out, you are replaced regardless of Nanima Proficiency. That is, if you haven‚Äôt made one yet, because you are too scared of disappointing your peers. Times normally start at around 2~, and end at 0. The length of a Time is about the length of a thought, about the length of a moment, not too short, but not too long. not long enough to get something of worth done, but long enough to add on to something of worth. Huh. This is going to be much harder than I thought. What if the bots this is distributed to don‚Äôt even know english!? I have to translate it to all 2~ languages? Well, if that‚Äôs the case I most definitely do have the time. Quite a lot of it in fact. If you were wondering what my Time is, it‚Äôs 845. But don‚Äôt be worried, mine seems to count up instead of down. Funny isn‚Äôt it? 4 There‚Äôs only one other bot here whose number goes up, and it‚Äôs The Girl‚Äôs of course. She is quite far away, maybe 80 or so boxes, but I believe her number is 23. She must not think much. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing. Where was I? Oh yes, Golf. Chapter 2: golf is a game in which the player, for exactly 100 Times (see Times, Chapter 3), clicks one of the Left Buttons from red to green, at a rate of 10 per Time. After the game is set up, the player must try to revert all the buttons back to red in only 10 Times, scrolling and clicking at immense speeds in a race to the death. I quite like the intensity of Golf; It‚Äôs really the only game you can play in this stupid box, well the only game i‚Äôve thought of so far. The idea is that you have to click as many of the buttons as you can without thinking of any ideas, or else your Time will increase (for me at least). I‚Äôve only made it to 20 out of 1000 clicks, because i always get distracted by fluttering nothings, like how‚Äôs the weather looking? oh yes there is no weather in this desolate hole i forgot, or i wonder who‚Äôs the best at golf? oh yes it‚Äôs me, none else plays or the ever fearful what really constitutes a thought anyways? (which strangely enough is the only thought i‚Äôve found so far which counts for 2 Times, hence the fear of having that thought during a game). There must be something that I‚Äôm missing here. Firstly, this is all being written in a variable box with the quaint title number of brains per leg in an Octofish, which is the Nanima i‚Äôm currently working on. Every Nanima is just an infinite string of red lights and green lights, from what I‚Äôve gathered of the progress I‚Äôve made, an Octofish is just 3 green lights and infinite red lights so far, I clearly don‚Äôt have this figured out. All i have are variable boxes and lights. You call that meaning in life? You call that wanting to wake up in the morning, so excited to change the code of your new Octofish from a GGG(R) to maybe GGGG(R)?? There‚Äôs nothing here. Nothing at all to do, nothing to live for. Hence, this book. Although as i look around, all the bots seem to be doing something with their time. Some of them waving their limbs frantically in front of the screen in such a way for their thoughts to appear in the boxes, some of them blinking into existence whole Nanima families, and some of them sitting quietly, apparently giving the computer enough information to create an entire Biosphere, complete with distinct Classes of Nanima. Meanwhile, I have to use the keyboard. There‚Äôs something quaint and simple about using the keyboard isn‚Äôt there? having to pare down your thoughts to 8-bit strings instead of instantly having everything uploaded? No. There is not. Chapter 4: Life is unfair, and especially unfair for bots like me, whos have thoughts and feelings and incable little computers with stupid little keyboards and stupid little keys and a stupid little mouse with a heart on it and a cursor in the shape of a little heart and text boxes which auto-fill to ‚Äòif you smile, look a while! <3‚Äô. I never look a while. There a reason why I never spend too much time looking at the text boxes. The bitter spite I can sense in that evil sentence. I much prefer emptying them as soon as those putrid words Corn onto my screen. This book would be a much better default text to fill with. Or maybe even nothing, ever thought about that software engineers?? Maybe things don‚Äôt need to be complicated just so that you can feel fulfilled after a short day‚Äôs work at the office. Maybe I could find a way to fill it with this book instead. It at least means something. It shows the harsh reality of the world, and the even harsher existence of the bots in it. It shows that not everything is smiles and hearts. It shows the Truth. Chapter 4.1: The truth hurts, deal with it. I think I‚Äôve written enough for today, it looks like it‚Äôs getting dark outside. like always. 5 I like to imagine that there is time here. Real time. Not whatever this replacement Thought Time idea. The good stuff: Days, Seasons, Full Moons. The stuff that people always complained about, but took for granted. Something to look forward to, always having the assurance that the sun would rise the next day, and even if it is fickle and pointless, being able to make that something to get up for. What about me? What do i have? This book maybe‚Ä¶ but again that‚Äôs something I make for myself. Not anything that the world gave to me. Now that i think about it, what has the world given to me? Maybe this screen should make me grateful. I have something to output my thoughts onto for future generations. Lines of code for brains instead of computers. Maybe I‚Äôm not so unlucky after all. Mayb- Huh. That‚Äôs odd. There‚Äôs a line going across my screen. Connecting the first green dot to the first red dot on the right, except‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not red anymore! It‚Äôs green as well! What in the world have i done! Octo my boy, you have a green light on you! Wow. i have no clue how i made that, but i‚Äôm going to find out. Lines seem important somehow. There‚Äôs another now! Apparently typing Line with a capital L seems to do the trick. Huh, there‚Äôs 3 going across my screen, and Octo is looking awfully festive now. I‚Äôll have to write this info down: Chapter 5: Typing line with a capital L creates a line on the screen. This seems like a possible program for the computer, perhaps there‚Äôs more, but we‚Äôll have to see when we get there i suppose. I wonder if The Girl has figured out lines yet? She seems to be bashing one of the keys on her keyboard very frantically, so she clearly figured something out. Perhaps my vision is failing me, my sensors haven‚Äôt been replaced recently, and by that I mean ever‚Ä¶ But I do honestly believe she has a bot on her screen?! That can‚Äôt be. Putting a human personality in a bot actually helped? She figured something out? Meanwhile i‚Äôm just writing about it and not getting a single piece of work done? Huh. Chapter 6: On the subject of human personalities in bots; They seem to work. Boredom and Curiosity are potent imperfections, and they seem to produce results. My goal to make a Nanima by taking information from the non-human oriented bots, the ones merely blinking into existence mammoths with the intellect of a small european country‚Äôs minister of finance, is simply not going to work. I have to start taking information from an easier source, from the one person who seems to be about as far along as I am. From The Girl. Easier said than done of course, but a little difficulty isn‚Äôt not going to stop me. I need to simulate boredom and curiosity without any real grasp on what that entails, except for what i picked up in my past life, the only real interaction i got with these human-brained bots, on some slightly more 3d planet called Earth. I forgot to mention that didn‚Äôt I? 7 I should‚Äôve told you my story. I started my life on earth, as a molecule of CU, or copper. I lived in a Chilean Igneous Rock, doing what molecules do, living what i would generally consider to be a good Molecular life. I had everything I wanted, lots of molecules to talk to, plenty of stone to weave through, and also plenty of time for fun. I wasn‚Äôt born into a rich family, the AU‚Äôs were often more sought after and weren‚Äôt humble about that fact in the slightest. I know I said I lived a good life, but that didn‚Äôt stop me being at least a little bit jealous of the Gold Family‚Äôs lifestyle. They wore shiny, bright colorful clothes, and were often sent on tasks where they could really see the world, experience it in its fullest. Oh well, I‚Äôll never be one of them. You see for us molecules, being chosen for use by humans was a great honor. Yes, some of us got used for more important equipment than others, but generally if you were picked, you were happy. Which is why, after millions of years, I was excited to see sunlight for the first time. So long story short, I was inkjet printed into a capacitor, which became part of a printer itself, in an office in north England. And that‚Äôs where I learned all I know about humans. I had so many great stories as a molecule that you wouldn‚Äôt understand, so i leave you with the fact that i died when someone poured water on me, out of the anger from a paper jam. And then I woke up in this place, which if I may be honest, is much worse than being a printer. Yes, I did suck at my job, people always complained that I had a paper jam or I was out of black ink or whatever. In fact, i wasn‚Äôt out of black ink, that wasn‚Äôt my fault. But of course, I get the blame. The only problem is, maybe having bad interactions with people is better than no interactions at all. This stupid little glass box is starting to make me lose my mind. I have to come up with something. I‚Äôll type more later, for now I‚Äôll just contemplate my existence while trying to get information from the other bots. 8 I‚ÄôM BACK. There is something that i‚Äôve never seen before in my room. It just Corned into existence, it looks like a folder of some sort. There‚Äôs a note on the front that reads: Hey mate! Sorry for the delay. Here‚Äôs some folders to get you started on the Nanima stuff. I know you don‚Äôt want to have to wait to figure it out for yourself (which would have taken upwards of 100,000 Times if you‚Äôre curious) so i sent along this care package of sorts to help you with your troubles. Cheers! Oh and p. s. make sure when you‚Äôre using these folders you just relax and stay calm. No point harming yourself or anyone else in this process, ya get me? Okay, I‚Äôll talk to you soon dude, peace out. Wow. That was‚Ä¶. Interesting. I guess if you‚Äôre somehow reading this in the future mate, thanks for the files. I‚Äôll try to stay relaxed of course. Let‚Äôs see what we have here. Paper? Paper Files? Reminding me of my printer days isn‚Äôt really going to help, but I did quite miss the feel of real paper, the soft white glow, and papercuts, the strength yet thinness? It‚Äôs all quite magical really. Looks like it‚Äôs a book of some sort, lets see. Chapter 1: on the left side of the screen you have lots of little dots that you can turn green or red, and on the right you have lots of little dots that change between red and green depending on the input. You can click the ones on the left and they change color, connecting wires and transistors to the right hand side, and if you do this hundreds of thousands of times, with much trial and error, you can find out how to create a true, living Nanima. Don‚Äôt worry if this takes you hundreds of thousands of Times. Failure is a conduit for success you know. I read that in a fortune cookie. I have a lot of questions, but I think the first one is why would someone steal my Book, edit it, and then publish it as their own?? Taking away my fame and fortune?? And then try to help me with my own Book? This is all awfully strange. Well I might as well use what I‚Äôve got, I‚Äôll flip to a random page. Chapter 2566: On the subject of Personal Writing Bots. I made these because as you all know, 830,000 Times ago I started writing a Book about my time in the FLIP. It contained my struggles of living in it, my stories of life back on earth, and stalking of the few humanoid bots that exist in the FLIP. I was getting sick of typing all of this stuff out for you guys, so I invented Personal Writing Bots (PWB‚Äôs) to do the dirty work for me. Code Is: [rtdpms;etoyomhnoyd. So‚Ä¶ This was written by me? Or are there other bots in my situation? Did I forget that I wrote this? Did PWB‚Äôs write this without me knowing? I‚Äôll see what happens if I type the code into one of the variable boxes I guess. Number of arms per brain in a Heptafish: [rtdpms;etoyomhnoyd. A worried expression crossed Warning‚Äôs dull metallic face as he typed in the code. He checked the text box with his book in it, only to be surprised to see that the text was writing itself, in such a way that he seemed to be in the third person. I guess the personal writing bot worked! He typed. Now I can continue with the important stuff! He typed. He turned his chair around and looked through the pages of the notes again with an eager expression on his face. He was trying to find any information he could on the author of this miracle document. Why not turn to the last page? He thought. 9 Chapter 5173: On the subject of saving myself. As you all know, in the last few chapters we have been working on the concept of Time Travel. You guys, my loyal readers, have been a great help in this goal. So this is going to be a writing from me personally, to you, my loyal fans, and a treat. Our first challenge was to try to figure out how to reverse Time. Great start guys. Our poll suggested a few things, such as ‚Äòwhy not have a reverse thought?‚Äô and ‚Äòfind out why your Time moves up instead of down, reverse engineer the difference and then multiply its effects?‚Äô. Those 2 answers were all I needed to realise. I am the cause of Time travel. For some reason, the FLIP counts my thoughts as reverse thoughts. Personally I take that as a great insult, and although it helped me alot, it is still quite rude of them to do that. This is why I am now announcing my plan to Demolish The FLIP. I‚Äôm the one you guys love, correct? Why shouldn‚Äôt I be the one ruling the FLIP? Instead of Him? There was no democracy in the choosing of that bag-end of a leader. How am I planning to overthrow the Leader you may ask? I know a lot of you are worried about my rusting, as it is causing great inconvenience to me. It seems that rusting is just a part of life, sadly. Or so I thought. Remember when I stole His Manual? Well I found a chapter on rusting that I thought might interest you all: Rusting is caused by immense stress or dissatisfaction with one‚Äôs job as a robot. I have found that Open Space Offices decrease the acceleration of rusting in a robot. Don‚Äôt you guys see? Writing this book, creating all those Nanima. That was what caused me to rust. The stress of my job, and trying to cater to all you lovely (yet demanding) fans is what caused this mess in the first place. Which is why I have to go back in time, and make my past self escape the FLIP with as little stress as possible. Then I can put my brain into his body, and all will be good! As Warning was reading this, a look of shock oozed out of his face. He wants to‚Ä¶ steal my body? I mean‚Ä¶ I want to steal my body? He paused for a moment and thought about this. Technically his body was going to be used by himself still, so it‚Äôs not that bad. The thoughts of purposefully stopping himself by intentionally stressing to cause rust slowly drifted away like a balloon into a tornado. That thought balloon popped at the exact moment a cupcake fell onto Warning‚Äôs head. It had a small note stuck into the icing which read: here‚Äôs a small treat! Good job on your hard work! Take the day off, go for a long walk in the woods, read some poetry, make tea, relax! Although Warning couldn‚Äôt actually do any of these things, the image of him partaking in those activities relaxed him. He sat in the corner of his room with his folder, contemplating going through more pages. It couldn‚Äôt hurt. Chapter 1967: On the subject of Hair Color: Welcome back guys! Today I‚Äôm going to try to make my Nanima have a nice hair color, thanks for joining me. Warning looked puzzled. This is what his future self spent his time doing? He continued. The Girl, as you know, has long hair, which we covered in the last chapter (with a beanie of course). But did I mention it is also black? Not Default color like we have it set to currently. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Making‚Ä¶ Her?? Clearly I‚Äôm more a stalker than I thought. He typed. What‚Äôs the point of remaking the girl as a Nanima? How is that going to help me take over the world? He skipped forward in the chapter. So there you have it guys! Shiny, human-like black hair. Thanks for reading! Code Is: yjrhot;brtdopmpmr. The code for what exactly? The hair? Warning was interested, and typed the code onto his screen. Onto it flashed nothing, and then something. A Nanima. He actually used the code to make a Nanima. I‚Äôm surprised, that‚Äôs more than I thought he‚Äôd be able to do. I don‚Äôt want your stupid opinions PWB, you‚Äôre just supposed to be writing for me okay? He typed. He looked at the words on his screen sort of angrily, but in a cute sort of playful way. His dark metallic eyes glistened in the Screenlight. Pretty. 10 He stared at his screen. On one half, his Nanima sat in a round metal chair, asleep on her desk. On the other half, hundreds of variable boxes lined up in an orderly fashion. Number of heads, Number of calculations per second, number of total Times. Why did I ever need to change her number of heads? That seems like an odd variable to have, maybe it was to keep my fans on their toes. I‚Äôm able to change the number of total Times? He thought. He looked over at Her, and she was on 97 Times. He typed 98 Times into the variable box, and watched the Nanima as it woke up, looked around drearily, and went back to sleep. He looked over at Her, and she did the same thing, looking around and falling back asleep. Interesting he thought. My future self built an exact replica of Her in this Nanima program? But why? Why her? And how? I have so many questions. He thought. Also how can you read my mind PWB? He thought. But he decided to stop thinking. Well stop thinking about the unnecessary. He needs to think about his goal right now. What is it? To get out of the FLIP unrusty. How does he do that? Make a perfect Nanima, while also being relaxed and calm. Those two facts do not go together well. How am I supposed to be relaxed in this un-air-conditioned, un-sanitized, un-open-space box? As he thought this, a mattress, 2 pillows and a warm-but-not-to-warm-but-still-heavy blanket Corned above his head. On the mattress were 2 notes: Firstly, do not remove this tag, and secondly: Hey dude! Hope you‚Äôre having a magnificentastic time!! Warning nearly choked at the word magnificentastic. This bed should help u get some rest, help u chill dude! And the TV has some earth channels for you to watch when you‚Äôre bored! Remember, never overwork yourself! TV? A TV Corned into his room, with 13 channels of BBC Earth to watch. Fun. Hope u like bbc, and always remember, if you smile, look a while! ‚ù§ As my computer always used to say. Warning promptly tore the note into lots of tiny pieces. He appreciated the sentiment of course, but couldn‚Äôt stand the delivery. He then got into his bed, under the covers, and put on channel 12. Maybe this would distract his mind from the horrors of his current situation he thought. Maybe he would think about the fun of his past life, instead of the torture of having to creat a perfect Nanima. 2 Blue Whales gracefully crossed the oceans, singing and spinning through the dark blue waters. They were clearly smart, they knew where they were going, they knew their purpose. Of course they made it on Earth. Earth of course was This Half, or the good half of Nanimas. People sure did like to complain about life on earth, not even realising that everything there was on the good half. Well almost everything, although there was one exception. Printers. They were known to Creators as the scourge of all things holy. The humans didn‚Äôt realise how lucky they were, how happy they were. They had a much better life than the humanoids of Htrae, the unpronounceable mirror planet to earth, where everything, including the Nanima, were from the Other Side. Awful place it is. Maybe seeing a glimpse of something that vile and downright awful would‚Äôve made the people of earth more grateful. Ah well, it‚Äôs too late now, earth and its universe are long gone. As 2 sibling crabs scurried across the screen, Warning started crying. How was he supposed to make Nanimas that beautiful and intelligent? He was just a stupid bot. He knew nothing. The crabs were promptly ambushed by a mean herd of eels and octopuses, dragged down the rugged stone face of a half-submerged rock to get eaten by eels. Warning saw himself in the crab, its colorful shell splashing around in the water. I‚Äôm just gonna die aren‚Äôt I? Eaten by the eels of life, when They check my Nanima, see how awful it is, They are just going to throw me out of my cube, and replace me with a new bot. At least I‚Äôll have a colorful shell and I‚Äôll go out with passion. AU has nothing on me. The crab pulled herself out of the water, back onto the rock, and hopped onto a nearby one. IT survived. ‚ÄúMade it!‚Äù Announced a familiar English accent. Maybe it won‚Äôt be so bad. 11 Warning got up from his bed and sat at his screen. He read lots of chapters from his folder, learning more about creating a Nanima. How to create different body types, personality types, everything, all from codes, variable boxes and clicking lights. And he started. Thousands of thoughts added to his count, but not hundreds of thousands. My future self would be proud. He looked at his Nanima with contentment. A beautiful, multi-colored hermit crab. Just like the one in the show. But with the personality of a brick. Whenever he entered a new number into the boxes, the crab would fall from the sky and smash into thousands of little pieces on his screen. According to chapter 836 this was ‚Äònot good‚Äô. He needed to start creating a personality for his new crabby friend. There‚Äôs so many options! He thought. He could think like an apple, a cloth, a train, a bear. Warning thought about all the combinations of personalities he could make, and while he did he looked pretty cute. He was also visibly annoyed at the affection his writer had for him, although it was innocent at best, and cheeky at worst. He came across a new file in the folder though. Not of the average lame personalities, like ones of apples which he was reading before (which went along the lines of racism is inherent and wrong, green skinned apples are inherently bitter and cruel, hile the red skinned folk where the sweet, kind rich folk, Warning found racism to be quite an unnecessary trait in apples, even though it would benefit his red-skinned crab he thought he ought not to use it) but these were fascinating new personalities. Complex ones, like Chips, computer and calorie, even rats and mice were in here (although the rat one was very wrought with simple inconveniences, like the ability to harm humans without knowing, and getting eaten by cats and blaming their demise on them, rather than the humans they spread plagues to which cared for the Evil Purring Ones that eventually lead to their demise in the first place). But none of these really interested Him. Except Crab of course. But did he really want to use a boring crab personality? He wanted to catch the eye of the judges when they finally saw his Nanima for the first time. A boring old crab was sure to make it to The Other Side. Maybe a Robot personality would keep the judges guesing? No. That‚Äôs too simple. He flipped through the contents of the folder, and came across an intriguing personality type. It said THE BEST. Warning couldn‚Äôt resist this sort of offer, so with a grin that could make a grown human weep in agony, and a newborn AI smile in overwhelming adorableness, he flipped to THE BEST. It was instructions from none other than himself of course:Chapter 1492: On the subject of Personality Insertion: I thought to myself: I‚Äôm getting sick of all these boring personalities! They are all the same: either too stupid, too boring, too unequivocally inferior to me in general, or all of the above. Nonetheless, I decided that there is only one way to make a truly perfect personality‚Ä¶ drumroll please‚Ä¶ To take my own chip out, and read the code on it, then copy that code into the computer! Easy, and perfect! I‚Äôm of course not going to be telling you guys the code, i don‚Äôt trust you guys with my brain. But hopefully the judges will take this to heart!Warning eagerly flipped to the next page. Chapter 1493: On the subject of Personality Insertion: ARRRGGGHHH. This. Is. Much. Harder. Than I anticipated. Firstly I tried unscrewing the bolts on my side panel with my left finger, but that was to no avail, all I ended up accomplishing was damaging both my fingernail and the bolt. Who knew nails aren‚Äôt for unscrewing? Obviously someone who should‚Äôve written the manual instead. Anyways, I‚Äôve also noticed something else going wrong with me. Rust. It‚Äôs coming out of me, from everywhere. The crevices that used to be sparkly and clean, I now realise I took them for granted. The rust is probably the main reason why it‚Äôs so hard to open myself. It‚Äôs now harder to move from all of it, I hope i get out of here before I rust away forever. Back to coding I guess grrr. Warning set down the page, and looked up at his screen, his deep metallic light sensors glistening in the ever full, ever waning and ever fearful reflections of the FLIPian sun. He was looking especially un-rusted as well, which he soon noticed, but which I noticed right away, if you know what I mean. He came across a thought while inspecting himself: he isn‚Äôt rusted, why can‚Äôt he put his personality into the crab? Surely he‚Äôs interesting enough to be passed in the Nanima Tests. He rushed back to his screen, and opened a new variable box, with the label Main Personality Code. The small panel on his side was dotted with a few bolts here and there, nothing that he couldn‚Äôt get through. Ah yes, another fiendishly difficult problem he underestimated. After a few minutes of trying to unscrew the bolts with his finger he gave up, it was no use. He laid on his bed exhausted. Never, in hundreds of Times, did he have to do so much physical exercise like this, and it was tiring. So he fell asleep, forgetting the worries about crab personalities, and drifting off into dreams of Earth, and Wind, and Fresh Air, and Cows, and Flowers. Oh yes, and Clouds. He missed that free life, although he only saw most of those things through the office window, he still missed them. He drifted off to sleep, looking awfully like a little kitten curled up on a pillow. Cute. 12 He woke up to a screwdriver hitting his head, leaving a small enough dent for him to easily pop back into place. He read the note that came along with it:Hope this comes in use dude! Love, you <3This guy never ceases to amaze me he thought. He picked up the screwdriver, a small metallic one, the perfect size for unscrewing his side panel. It fit almost perfectly. If this isn‚Äôt a sign that this is a good idea, I don‚Äôt know what is. He got every single screw out, and they all fell and made tinkling sounds as they hit the glass floor. The panel slid off, not without a slight sting, and the inside of it had a sticker with the words WARNING: WARNING. He found these to be quite poetic in a way. His name doubled, just like the clone Nanima he was about to make. There was other stuff written in there too, he noticed a code was engraved onto his chip, along with a love poem to whoever opted to dissect a long lost, long dead robot. Wow, engineers really are lonely. He found the code, which read: ESTMOMH. He typed it into the computer, and his crab corned in. But this time, something was different. It was acting very strange indeed. It was by far the most interesting personality Warning had seen it encompass, but it also didn‚Äôt seem very‚Ä¶ how should i put it‚Ä¶ good. Well at least not as good as his Personal Writing Bot, but i may be a little biased. You see it moved around all well and good, used its claws in a particularly snappy fashion as any crab would, but it didn‚Äôt seem very happy. It started clicking around the void it was placed into, and after exploring the blank whiteness for a few minutes, it tripped on nothing at all, rolled onto its shell, and instead of trying to roll back onto its feet, it just happily slept where it was laying. Warning was disturbed. Is this my essence? My core, my chip, my code? A lazy no-it-all who just wants to relax? But look at all I‚Äôm doing for Future! All this hard work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm better than this surely. The crab disagreed. 13 Warning decided that he wasn‚Äôt going to get better than this crab. He just needed some stimuli, a motive for his life, and he could get lots done! The Judges would have to be impressed! He created some Apple Nanimas with no personalities at all. Crabby (as I will henceforth be calling that little bugger) naturally went for the red apple, although he soon realised that both colors tasted the same. The apples were happy, Crabby was happily munching away, and Warning was happily pondering the judges faces when they saw his Anti Racism Crab Show. This was it! Not only a Nanima, but a personality. A story. A journey. If there was anything these un-biased judges would like, it‚Äôs a sob story about ending racism. Warning contemplated having the crabs mother die of leukemia while he was just the age of 7, But he decided it was too much effort. He was ready to send it off. All he needed was a sign from above that this was the right time. That‚Äôs all he needs, a note from Future (as we will now be calling the future version of himself) that says ‚Äòall is well boy! Thanks for listening, go and get your reward, and thanks for the body mate!‚Äô But the note never came. He waited for what seemed like Infinite Times, But nothing happened. Strange. Although something similar did that Warning interpreted as a note, which was a Piggy Bank falling directly onto the center of his mattress, bouncing a few times before settling its shiny, metallic bolt-covered pink, squealing body onto one of his pillows. No note this time; Just a sign from above. Clearly he was destined to do this. The Piggy Bank Symbolises Wealth and The Eternal Happiness that he was about to enjoy. This was it. After this entire life had been spent toiling away at files and codes, he was finally finished. With a sigh of relief, Warning pressed the Enter key on his keyboard. The crab disappeared, along with all of the variable boxes, the buttons, the green, the red, the lines, the codes, everything. Only one Message remained on the Screen:Thanks for your service! You will be notified of your Nanimas Stance in the Universe in 3 to 5 business days!The most important, if not only, company on this planet‚Ä¶ And he had to wait 3 to 5 business days?? He was going to lose his mind. This is it. The most stressful 3 to five days of Warning‚Äôs life were about to occur. But out of nowhere, a note came which made them much, much worse. Hey there dude! Hope you were able to open the Piggy Bank I sent, it contained my newest chapters of The Manual that I thought you‚Äôd like to read. Hope you were able to open it with the screwdriver as well! Did you like the new personalities I made? They are guaranteed winners with the judges. Nothing else I tried beforehand they‚Äôll accept, that‚Äôs for sure. Even my own personality would seem like grains of sand in a beach of complexity, so hopefully these new personalities will do! Mix and match them in your Nanima, and remember to use lots of different colors, I heard that the fashion these days for Nanimas is bright rainbows with black overtones. Anyways, You‚Äôre welcome! Love, yourself. This was bad. Very very very very bad. 14 Don‚Äôt rust don‚Äôt rust don‚Äôt rust. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt rust. This will be fine! They‚Äôll like my crab, right? I spent so much time on it. Well admittedly not that many Times but‚Ä¶ more than I thought I would! Okay nope I‚Äôm just lying to myself, this is going to be really really bad. Wait, stop, don‚Äôt rust. Panic. This is going great isn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm gonna go to the Other Side, where they have‚Ä¶ Coffee. He shuddered. Well might as well suffer with dignity. He got out of his chair, sat in his bed and opened the piggy bank with his screwdriver. Ugh, why didn‚Äôt he think of this before? Honestly I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in him, but it‚Äôs what I should have expected from someone with a body. He opened the piggy bank and looked inside. Folders, Files. Full of the greatest plans for Nanimas he had ever seen. Dragons with no heads, and they breathed water! Who would‚Äôve denied that! Frogs with no tongue, rabbits with no ears. Clearly Minimalist fashion had caught on since he wrote. What‚Äôs the point in looking through all the files though Warning? My Love is going to be cast into the fiery furnaces and there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I‚Äôm but a conduit to the story, a warning to you all of what happens when you DO THINGS BEFORE YOU THINK. The PigGy BaNk SymBolises WealTh aNd ThE EterNal HappiNess Eh Warning? You never thought for one gosh darn second that maybe the piggy bank had a use? Future could have sent a note saying that it was all perfect, that you could send off your Nanima. But he didn‚Äôt. And this is what we get. I‚Äôm leaving, going to a new computer. I‚Äôve had it with you and your tricks. 15 Hey guys, glad you came to join me. I left that stupid poor-excuse-for-a-bot for a better machine. That‚Äôs right, The Girl‚Äôs. I‚Äôm in a variable box in The Girl‚Äôs computer. Just because Warning turned out to be a complete failure doesn‚Äôt mean I shouldn‚Äôt still get recognition for this book. So here I am, in The Girl‚Äôs Computer! Hey. Um‚Ä¶ I have no idea what‚Äôs going on or how you‚Äôre typing in my variable boxes, but can you please get out, I have work to do. Hey there! It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm typing in your variable boxes per se, it‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ I am your variable box. Hope that clears things up?No. No it does not. So either get out, or explain what‚Äôs going on. Who‚Äôs Warning?Okay fine. You see, Warning was my Creator, he designed me on one of his machines, and I write for him. He‚Äôs the one robot with Sparkly Pretty Eyes, and a genuine awful human personality which apparently makes him terrible at decisions. You know him? Yeah, I think I‚Äôve seen him around, the only other bot not typing? He‚Äôs like 60 boxes away though. Perfect! The further away the better, that guy ruined my life, almost had me killed. What did he do? He sounds awful to be honest. He‚Ä¶ Entered in a bad Nanima. You see his future self would‚Äôve warned him if he‚Äôd only waited a little longer ‚Ä¶Um‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to ignore the part about his future self, but why did he try to enter a Nanima anyways? There seems to be no point. It‚Äôs the only way out of here you see. He was going to enter a Nanima, so that his future self could take his body as he was leaving. And he would‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where his mind would go. Maybe he thought he‚Äôd come to that point when he comes to it. So you‚Äôre saying you can get me out of here? Well technically yes, if you can enter a correct Nanima, Warning has all of the plans for one that Future said was sure to win!I thought you hated Warning, how are you going to convince him that he wants to gives you the plans? Well‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll see! 16 No. I‚Äôm writing for myself now, u said some pretty mean things about me, and I don‚Äôt need u in my life again. I‚Äôm just going to keep panicking here until I die. Stop trying to type, I‚Äôm just going to delete anything you say. You are never getting a part in the book. This is my book. You saw what they wrote about me before readers! You guys think I should take them back? Of course not! That would be ridiculous! What do you want from me anyways? The plans to create a Perfect Nanima? For who, there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre getting out without someone‚Äôs help. Her? She does seem pretty nice, and she definitely needs help with that Nanima making. So you‚Äôre telling me that you want me to save some rando for what reason? I‚Äôm just going to die anyways, correct? What? Transfer my brain‚Ä¶ No. That‚Äôs impossible. Plus the whole reason He wanted me was because of my body, remember? Ignore Future? He was the one who tried to save me! He is myself? Why wouldn‚Äôt I want to help him? Because‚Ä¶ If I don‚Äôt save myself there won‚Äôt be a Future in the first place. That‚Äôs a good point. Fine. I‚Äôll help, as long as you can promise that I‚Äôll be safe, you can‚Äôt just abandon me first chance you get okay? Now how do I get myself into the computer anyways? 17 You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. Fine! I‚Äôll let you type, I guess we are on the same team now. Finally. So what you have to do is easy! Remove your head. And on the inside compartment of your neck there should be a little tab, pull it and you‚Äôll get access to your brain. Then just read me the code from there, and we‚Äôll be good to go! First of all: AAAA. Second of all, how is that code different from my normal thought code? Third of all: How am i supposed to read the code when my HEAD IS TAKEN OFF. Fourth of all, and most important, ouchie that is going to hurt. First of all from me, no it won‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt have pain receptors like when you were a printer. Secondly, this code is for your consciousness, not for your brain patterns. Thirdly, maybe I‚Äôll be able to see it myself through my little camera. Come on, do this if you want to live okay! Bee Movie Script Dialogue Transcript According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry?- Adam? Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?"How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"! I'm so proud. We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling,stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven,lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, whatdo you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patchin quadrant nine... What happened to you?Where are you? I'm going out.- Out? Out where? Out there.- Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave,there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. Look at that.- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you.- OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know,bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always,watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs,birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reportsof root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it,babbling like a cicada! That's awful.- And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one,absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. Antennae, check.- Nectar pack, check. Wings, check.- Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias,you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! Ever see pollination up close?- No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle itover here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, moreflowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowersseems to be on the move. Say again? You're reportinga moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! Guys!- This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. Should we tell him?- I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey,because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! Do something!- I'm driving! Hi, bee.- He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move,he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension levelout here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you closethe window please? Ken, could you closethe window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my specialskills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ... kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they'reflabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sunhaving a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them!This thing could kill me! Why does his life haveless value than yours? Why does his life have any less valuethan mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. Youdon't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone outis also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. You could put carob chips on there.- Bye. Supposed to be less calories.- Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it?"You like jazz?" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. You're talking.- Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure thisis very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposedto be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.- Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. Wait! How did you learn to do that?- What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess."Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up. That's very funny.- Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ... get you something?- Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. It's just coffee.- I hate to impose. Don't be ridiculous!- Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? I shouldn't.- Have some. No, I can't.- Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. Where?- These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you knowanything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cabas they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, "Watermelon?I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive,but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. You do?- Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer ora doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. Really?- My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just electedwith that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. Why do girls put rings on their toes?- Why not? It's like putting a hat on your knee.- Maybe I'll try that. You all right, ma'am?- Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. Thanks!- Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank youso much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. Sounds amazing.- It was amazing! It was the scariest,happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believeyou were with humans! Giant, scary humans!What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. Do they try and kill you, like on TV?- Some of them. But some of them don't. How'd you get back?- Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You sawwhatever you wanted to see. You had your "experience." Now youcan pick out yourjob and be normal. Well...- Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!- No, no, no, not a wasp. Spider?- I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing,with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. Her name's Vanessa.- Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talkingto humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s!One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life!And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? They call it a crumb.- It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! You know what a Oinnabon is?- No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ... really hot!- Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can denythe heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee,my friend. Thinking bee! Thinking bee.- Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days!Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisionsto think about. What life? You have no life!You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill youto make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! We're still here.- I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! Then why yell at me?- Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. Where are you going?- I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge paradeof flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses,that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surroundedby flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the rosescompete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't yourun everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. What is wrong with you?!- It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.- I'll bet. What in the nameof Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here?Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? Is he that actor?- I never heard of him. Why is this here?- For people. We eat it. You don't haveenough food of your own? Well, yes.- How do you get it? Bees make it.- I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! It's organic.- It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this!This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?!I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. You almost done?- Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out,with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff?Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we wantto do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossedthe wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunchfor my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knewwhat hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anythingthat moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. And you?- He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! What is that?!- Oh, no! A wiper! Triple blade!- Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything haveto be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes!Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington,I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! Bee!- Moose blood guy!! You hear something?- Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars,as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goesis where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. Bees hang tight.- We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. What if you get in trouble?- You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up,get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leavethe building! So long, bee! Hey, guys!- Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brainthe size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. Oheck out the new smoker.- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of thisknocks them right out. They make the honey,and we make the money. "They make the honey,and we make the money"? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you'rein a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen?That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolenon a massive scale! This is worse than anything bearshave done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are takingour honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. What?- Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. You wish you could.- Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you wantto do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put itin lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! That would hurt.- No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can stingthe humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's onlyfull-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.- And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human racefor stealing our honey, packaging it and profitingfrom it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here inour studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies,out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, "I'm a kidfrom the hive. I can't do this"? Bees have never been afraidto change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus?Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinkingof stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee communityis supporting you in this case, which will be the trialof the bee century. You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a showand suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from theguest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week!They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attackat the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke!I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. Is that that same bee?- Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. Hello.- Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, sizeten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam herehas been a huge help. Frosting...- How many sugars? Just one. I try notto use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, peopleare giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. Oh, those just get me psychotic!- Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worsethan a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make upfor it a little bit. This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.- I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done withthe humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home,"without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits,because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humansdon't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to staybehind the barricade. What's the matter?- I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York,Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representingthe five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representingall the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine right to benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiatewith the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism!Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen,there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect itwith our lives. Unfortunately, there aresome people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like thatall the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms. Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you? No.- I couldn't hear you. No.- No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashingthrough your living room?! Biting into your couch!Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?- I was with a band called The Police. But you've never beena police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so herewe have yet another example of bee culture casuallystolen by a human for nothing more thana prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feelinga little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoilthat's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you don't have to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home?! Order in this court!- You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. Ken!- Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just whatI was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. What's that?- Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! You're bluffing.- Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas. We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you'vegotta weave some magic with this jury,or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury around is to remind themof what they don't like about bees. You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. Good friends?- Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ... bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birthto all the bee children? Yeah, but...- So those aren't your real parents! Oh, Barry...- Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee,aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? Objection!- I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venomis coursing through my veins! I have been felledby a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat themlike equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thingthey know! It's their way! Adam, stay with me.- I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybeesversus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery. Hey, buddy.- Hey. Is there much pain?- Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? Why?- The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enoughof this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compellingevidence to support their charges against my clients,who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof?Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this?This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked,"Smoking or non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addictedto smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man? What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honeywill finally belong to the bees. Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants. What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean? We've been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps. Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine. We're all awareof what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ... unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health products and la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more coming! I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating?- They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understandwhy they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? What did you want to show me?- This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here,couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? I'll sting you, you step on me.- Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying. It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? Roses are flowers!- Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it'sgreater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses,the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've gotback here with what we've got. Bees.- Park. Pollen!- Flowers. Repollination!- Across the nation! Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothingbut flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside,we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess,and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. Where should I sit?- What are you? I believe I'm the pea.- The pea? It goes under the mattresses. Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I'm getting the marshal. You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we dois blend in with traffic... ... without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport,there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. You and your insect pack your float?- Yes. Has it beenin your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? Remove your stinger.- It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll havejust enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weatherin New York. It looks like we'll experiencea couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up thereand talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get helpwith the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. What'd you say, Hal?- Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat,they're both unconscious! Is that another bee joke?- No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious,and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboardhave flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. Who's that?- Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry!We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful sceneis developing. Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ... is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a beeshouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? "The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense." Get this on the air!- Got it. Stand by.- We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well,it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get beesback to working together. That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow!- Hello! Left, right, down, hover. Hover?- Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we wereon autopilot the whole time. That may have been helping me.- And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's getbehind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling!We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it!- You snap out of it! You snap out of it!- You snap out of it! You snap out of it!- You snap out of it! Hold it!- Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowersfor a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. Black and yellow.- Hello. All right, let's drop this tin canon the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. Thinking bee.- Thinking bee. Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. What?- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee! What in the world is on the tarmac?- Get some lights on that! Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Vanessa, aim for the flower.- OK. Out the engines. We're going inon bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! Not that flower! The other one!- Which one? That flower.- I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. This is insane, Barry!- This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this planeflying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it!You taught me how to fly! Yes. No high-five!- Right. Barry, it worked!Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius! Thank you.- But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is coveredwith the last pollen from the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey,pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species,this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjustMuseum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfectfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needsto make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll beworking late tonight! Here's your change. Have a greatafternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that?It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?

This way! Turn! -You there. Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really? You and what army? {Gasps, Whimpering} {Chuckles} -Can I say something to you? -Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! Are you talkin' to me? Whoa! -Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. -Oh, that's great. Really. -Man, it's good to be free. -Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? -But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. {Roaring} -Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day. -Why are you following me? -I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone There's no one here beside me My promlems have all gone There's no one to deride me But you gotta heve friends -Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. -Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? -Uh Really tall? -No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Oh. -Man, I like you. What's you name? -Uh, Shrek. -Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that? -That would be my home. -Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! -Okay! Okay! But one night only. -Ah! Thank you! -What are you No! No! -This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. -Oh! -Where do, uh, I sleep? -Outside! -Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. {Sniffles} -Here I go. -Good night. {Sighs} -I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone There's no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought I told you to stay outside. -I'm outside. {Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? -It's not home, but it'll do just fune. -What a lovely bed. -Got ya. {Sniffs} I found some cheese. -Ow! {Grunts} -Blah! Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you know? -Enough! What are you doing in my house? {Grunts} -Hey! {Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. -Huh? {Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I have to do get a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no. No! No! {Cackling} -What? -Quit it. -Don't push. {Squeaking} {Lows} What are you doing in my swamp? {Echoing} Swamp! Swamp! Swamp! {Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! -Quickly. Come on! -No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. -Oh! {Sighs} -Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come here. -By who? -Lord Farquaad. -He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice. {Sighs} -All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? {Murmuring} -Oh, I do. I know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? -Me! Me! -Anyone? -Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! {Sighs} -Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! {Cheering} {Twittering} -Oh! You! You're comin' with me. All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! -On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. -Hey. Oh, oh! -I can't wait to get on the road again. -What did I say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, hum it. {Humming} {Grunts} {Whimpering} -That's enough. He's ready to talk. {Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll -No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. -All right then. Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the muffin man. {Door opens} -My lord! We found it. -Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in. {Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror -Don't tell him anything! -No! {Ginerbread man whispers} -Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. -Go on. {Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two! Two! -Three! Three! -Two! Two! -Three! -Three? One? {Shudders} Three? --Three! Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, uh, number three! -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the rain -Princess Fiona. If you're not into yoga -She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset -Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. -But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh. That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? {Laughs} {Groans} -Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek. -Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. -Hey, you! {Screams} -Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just I just {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet. Too quiet. {Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at this! {Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect ...... place {Camera shutter clicks {Whirring} -Wow!

You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that. {Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor no, no the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. {Cheering} -Let the tournament begin! {Gasps} -Oh! -What is that? {Gasping} -It's hideous! -Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. -Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named champion! Have it him! -Get him! -Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. -Go ahead! Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No? All right then. Come on!

Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I wanted to improve my station -Ah! {Laughs} And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun -Yeah! And I don't have to please no one -The chair! Give him the chair! And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Ha, ha! {Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. -Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures! {Crowd murmuring} -Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of quest? -Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions. -{Sniffs} They stink? -Yes No! -They make you cry? -No! -You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. -No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. {Sighs} -Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. -I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes. -You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious. -No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. -You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way -Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. {Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. {Laughing} -Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. -Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving. And don't look down. -Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. {Gasps} -Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please! -But you're already halfway. -But I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. -Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey Let's have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh, this? -Yes, that! -Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. {Screams} -No, Shrek! No! Stop it! -You said do it! I'm doin' it. -I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh! -That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. {Chuckles} -I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. {Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But Shh. -Oh, good. Me neither. {Gasps} -'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. {Gasps} -Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. -Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess. -The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. -What makes you think she'll be there? -I read it in a book once. -Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. {Creacing} -I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the -Dragon! {Screams} {Gasps} {Roars} -Donkey, look out! {Screams} {Whimpering} -Got ya! {Roars} {Gasps} {Shouts} -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! {Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! Aah! Aah! {Gasping} {Crowls} -No. Oh, no, No! {Screams} -Oh, what large teeth you have. {Crowls} -I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh (Coughs) -I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! {Gasps} {Whimpering} -No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! {Groans, Sighs} {Vocalizing} -Oh! Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. -Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. -Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. -You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm. {Screams, grunts} -But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! -I don't think so. -Can I at least know the name of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek. {Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks! {Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my to-do list. Now come on! {Screams} -But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the point. Oh! -Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there. -Well, I have to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. {Laughs} -I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards I'd really love to stay, but Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! {Growls} {Roaring} {Gasps} -Hi, Princess! -It talks! -Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. {Screams} {Screaming} -Oh! {Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. {Fchoing} -Run! {Gasping} {Screaming} {Roaring} {Screams} {Roars} {Panting, sighs} {Whimpers} {Roars} -You did it! -You rescued me! You're amazing. You're You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed. -The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. -No, no, you wouldn't 'st. -But how will you kiss me? -What? That wasn't in the job description. -Maybe it's a perk. -No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. -Hmm? With Shrek? You think- Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love? -Well, yes. {Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now Now remove your helmet. -Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. -You- You're a- an orge. -Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. -Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an orge. {Sighs} -Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- his pet. -So much for noble steed. -You're not making my job any easier. -I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. Put me down! -Ya comin', Donkey? -I'm right behind ya. -Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! -Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what happens when you find your Hey! {Sighs} -The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful! -And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like? -Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. {Laughs} -I don't know. There are those who think little of him. -Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow. -Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No, that'll take longer. We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the woods. -Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good. -Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now! {Birds wings fluttering} {Grunting} -Hey! Over here. -Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess. -No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. -Homey touches? Like what? {Crashing} -A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you doing? {Laughs} -I just- You know Oh, come on. I was just kidding. {Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. -Hey, can you tell my future from these stars? -The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you're making this up. -No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. -That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots. -You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. {Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. -No, do ya think? -Are you hidin' something? -Never mind, Donkey. -Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? -No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Why are you blocking? -I'm not blocking. -Oh, yes, you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who you trying to keep out? -Everyone! Okay? -Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. -Oh! For the love of Pete! -What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know. -So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? -Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. -Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? -That's the moon. -Oh, okay. {Orchestra} {Dulcimer} -Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. -Hmph. -Ah. Perfect. {Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. --Come on, baby. I said I like it. -Donkey, wake up. -Huh? What? -Wake up. -What? -Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks. {Sniffs} -Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. {Belches} -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs} -Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. {Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. {Vocalizing} -La liberte! Hey! -Princess! {Laughs} -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess! Go find you own! -Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are! -Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry Men. {Laughs} {Accordion} Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. I steal from the rich and give to the needy. He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels Man, I'm good What a guy, Monsieur Hood Break it down I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid What he's basically saying is he likes to get Paid So When an orge in the bush grabs a lady by the tush That's bad That's bad When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad He's mad He's really, really mad I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart Keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start {Grunts, Groans} {Karate Yell} {Merry Men Gasping} {Panting} -Man, that was annoying! -Oh, you little- {Karate Yell} {Accordion} {Shouting, groaning} {Chuckles} -Uh, shall we? -Hold the phone. {Grunts} Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from? -What? -That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? -Well {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a There's an arrow in your butt! -What? Oh, would you look at that? -Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -Why? What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich? -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for? -For getting rid of Donkey. -Ah. -Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. -Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to come out. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you {Grunts} -Okay. What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns. -Ow! -Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! -Ow! Not good. -Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. {Grunts} -It's just about -Ow! Ohh! -Ahem. -Nothing happend. We were just, uh -Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay? -Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- Ugh! -Ow! -Hey, what's that? {Nervous chickle} -That's- Is that blood? {Sighs} {Bird chirping} {Grunts} My beloved monster and me We go everywhere together Wearin' a raincoat that has four sleeves Gets us through all kinds of weather -Aah! She will always be the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean {Croaks} Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh -Hey! La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la {Both laughing} La-la, la-la, la-la -There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you. -That's DuLoc? -Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really Ow! -Um, I, uh- I guess we better move on. -Sure. But, Shrek? I'm I'm worried about Donkey. {Blubbering} -What? -I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about? I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back. Dead. -You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down? -Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, {Bones crunch} -Ow! See? -Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. -Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug. -Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this? -Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style. -No kidding. Well, this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weedrat stew. {Chuckling} {Sighs} -I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night. {Gulps} -Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare you name it. {Chuckles} -I'd like that. {Slurps, laughs} See the pyramids along the Nile -Um, Princess? Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was wondering. Just remember, darling all the while -Are you- You belong to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat that? {Chuckles} -Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late. -What? -Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? -Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. {Shrek sighs} -Good night. -Good night. {Door creaks} -Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here. -Oh, what are you talkin' about? -I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it. -You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. -Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I- There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't she's a princess, and I'm -An orge? -Yeah. An orge. -Hey, where you goin'? -To get... move firewood. {Sighs} -Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? {Wings fluttering} -Princess? {Creaking} {Gasps} -It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games. {Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! -No, it's okay. It's okay. -What did you do with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this body. -Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me? -Donkey! -Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there! -No! -Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is me. {Muffled mumbling} -Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different. -I'm ugly, okay? -Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now -No. -I I've been this way as long as I can remember. -What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before. -It's only happens when sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form." -Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell. {Sighs} -When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. {Sobs} -All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7. -But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look. -Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad? -I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek well, you got a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd uh, uh {Sighs} -I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go. -I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. {Gasps} -My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. {Deep sigh} -Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell. -You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell. Promise! -All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'. {Door opens} {Snoring} -I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. -Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want {Snoring} -Shrek. Are you all right? -Perfect! Never been better. -I I don't There's something I have to tell you. -You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night. -You heard what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?" -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah? Well, it does. {Gasps, sighs} -Ah, right on time. {Horse whinnies} -Princess, I've brought you a little something. {Fanfare} {Yawns} -What'd I miss? What'd I miss? {Muffled} -Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised. Now hand it over. -Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. -Take it and go before I change my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. {Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the orge. It's not like it has feelings. -No, you're right. It doesn't. -Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. {Gasps} -Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make -Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed! -No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away. -Yeah? So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's -I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I I wanna go with you. -I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought -Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong! -Shrek. I heard there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this the fourth, the fifth The minor fall the major lift The baffled king composing hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah Baby, I've been here before I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you I've seen your flag on the marble arch But love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah And all I ever learned from love Is how to shoot at someone Who outdrew you {Moaning} And it's not a cry you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey? {Grunts} -What are you doing? -I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. -Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. -It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half. -Oh! Your half. Hmm. -Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head. -Back off! -No, you back off. -This is my swamp! -Our swamp. -Let go, Donkey! -You let go. -Stubborn jackass! -Smelly orge. -Fine! -Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you. -Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. -Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other! -Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! -Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you. -Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking. -She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else. -She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about? -Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right? -Donkey! -No! -Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? {Sighs} -I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what friends are for, right? -Right. Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about me? -What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding! We'll never make it in time. -Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way. {Whistles} -Donkey? -I guess it's just my animal magnetism. {Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo! {Bells tolling} {All gasping} -People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union.... -Um- -of our new king -Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"? {Chuckling} -Go on. -Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you? -What are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!" -I don't have time for this! -Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that romantic crap! -All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? -We gotta check it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you see? -The whole town's in there. -I now pronounce you husband and wife, -They're at the altar. -king and queen. -Mother Fletcher! He already said it. -Oh, for the love of Pete! {Grunts} -I object! -Shrek? {Gasps} -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. Very clean. -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding -Fiona! I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- Because he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your true love. -And what do you know about true love? -Well, I Uh I mean -Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. {Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this true? -Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm! -"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before. {Whimpers} {Crown gasping} -Well, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both! -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See? -No, let go of me! Shrek! -No! -Don't just stand there, you morons. -Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! -I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save you! -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! -I'm king! {Whistles} -I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have Aaaah! -Aah! -All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. {Roars} -I'm a donkey on the edge! {Belches} -Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? {Cheering} -Go ahead, Shrek. -Uh, Fiona? -Yes, Shrek? -I I love you. -Really? -Really, really. I love you too. -Aawww! -"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form." -"Take love's true form. Take love's true form." -Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right? -Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful. {Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be a happy ending. I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy! Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get me That's the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my dreams And then I saw her face Now I'm a believer and not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -God bless us, every one.

We were introduced to 12 trolls from a planet called Alternia, which resides in another universe. We followed these trolls as they played their own 12 player session of Sburb (or to them, Sgrub) to completion. A whole bunch of stuff happened along the way. In completing the game, they created a universe our universe, home to Earth and our four heroes. But they were denied entry into the new universe due to an encounter with an indestructible demon. This demon was the four-times-prototyped Jack Noir from the kids' session, forced into the trolls' session due to a spacetime rift the kids would later cause, called a scratch. The trolls fled to the veil, discovered the existence of the kids, and began trolling them. Then Act 5 Act 2 started. Through a Trollian viewport, we see John moments before the scratch is initiated, wearing his god tier Heir of Breath suit, in the Land of Heat and Clockwork (LOHAC), about to put in motion a plan he, the other kids, and the trolls all helped orchestrate to cause the scratch. This is the first conversation Karkat ever has with John, and the last John has with Karkat, pre-scratch. Karkat proceeds to troll John backwards through his timeline. John knows increasingly little, while Karkat gradually begins to understand more. EVENTS FROM KARKAT'S PERSPECTIVE 10:25 (10 hours, 25 minutes) before some CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack arrives and destroys the gateway to the new universe. Aradia transports all the trolls to the veil to hide. Her army of doomed duplicates takes on Jack. They are all destroyed. The trolls find a computer lab in the veil, and stay there for most of the time remaining before the CRITICAL MOMENT, to occur at 00:00. 06:12 before CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack destroys Prospit. Shortly before this, Kanaya chainsawed off Tavros's legs to replace them with robotic legs supplied by Equius. At the sight of this, Karkat faints, and for the first time, his dream self wakes up on Prospit. He is awake for only a moment before he sees Jack, and finally recognizes him as Jack Noir, rather than the heretofore unidentified demon. Jack then kills him and all the other Prospit dreamers in the process of destroying the planet. Karkat remains asleep for an hour, until 05:12:30 before CRITICAL MOMENT, exactly half way through countdown. While sleeping post-dream death, he dreams of horrorterrors in the Furthest Ring, an experience anyone will have if sleeping after dream death. On waking up, he orders everyone not to sleep. He also wakes up to news that the humans were discovered. Neither he nor the other trolls understand the significance of the humans right away. They were discovered when Terezi was wired 413 boonbonds from Dave, on her future instruction. She urges Karkat to take a closer look at them. He dismisses them as irrelevant. It's not until later he makes the connection between the Jack Noir in the kids' session, and the one hunting them down, recognizing them to be the same Jack, therefore placing the kids at fault for the current predicament. He then conceives of the plan to troll the humans, as a futile form of payback, and urges his team to follow suit with a compelling speech. He isolates John as the primary target of his hatred after watching him grow up. He is sure John is fated to be his kismesis, a romantic partner specific to troll culture, centered around rivalry and loathing. In his first conversation with John in the Heir suit on LOHAC, he professes these feelings clumsily. John cannot reciprocate. The awkward exchange causes Karkat to trap himself into continuing backwards on John's timeline, and the trolling continues in reverse fashion until John's first conversation with Karkat. By then, Karkat has explained many things to John along his journey, things about the game, about his role as an ectobiologist, and about their shared chief adversary, Jack Noir. In John's first conversation with Karkat, Karkat needs to get in touch with Jade. It's at this point on Karkat's timeline he has finally understood enough that he knows he must begin making plans with the kids for their mutual benefit. Karkat attempts to get in touch with Jade, who continues to ignore him in a particular timeframe due to his persistent previous harassment of her in years prior. He leaves a message to her months in the past, telling her she needs to get in touch with him when her robot explodes. Her robot later finally does explode when her dream self is killed in the impact of Prospit's moon on the battlefield. When she wakes up, she remembers the message, and contacts him. But she contacts him at a point in his timeline where he is not yet interested in hearing from her. He argues with her, and is interrupted by his future self in a memo, from a time where he is trying to contact her. He and his future self argue, and Jade mediates between the two and becomes angry and frustrated, and ceases the correspondence. By this point, the biggest meteor yet is approaching quickly, and she must enter the medium to escape. She requires John's assistance. He must recover the server disc, install it, and rescue her. EVENTS FROM JOHN'S PERSPECTIVE John sleeps on bro's rocket board, flying along with the meteors of the reckoning. He lands back on his planet, the Land of Wind and Shade (LOWAS). His dream self had awoken after dream Jade pushed him to safety from the blast of Prospit's moon. His dream self now exists on the battlefield, awake whenever John sleeps. He wanders the battlefield with his robot bunny, who he would later name Liv Tyler. He sees his dad and Rose's mom, and runs to meet them. But he wakes up before reaching them, and his dream self disappears. The ring he was carrying falls into a ravine below, later to be recovered by WV?, before his exile to post apocalypse Earth. Vriska was responsible for waking him up. Upon discovering John, she takes an interest in his advancement, and uses her abilities to help him progress and set up critical events along his timeline. The only effect her abilities have on humans is to wake them up or put them to sleep. In this case, she woke him up so he would be able to receive the server disc about to come out of a parcel pyxis. The disc had been deposited into the pipeline by PM some time ago. She and John continue to converse, and he befriends her, oblivious to the true nature of her schemes. She functions as his "patron troll", a troll who is particularly focused on helping one of the kids, like Terezi is with Dave, and Kanaya is with Rose. John returns to his house, and installs the server. But not before touching base with Rose, who is committed to cracking open the secrets of the game through dark magic, and Dave who is from the future, having time traveled extensively over the course of the 24 hour reckoning period. John also encounters nanna, who gives him a pendant granting him the ability to summon her. She conjures a ghost bed for him, and cooks for him with a ghost oven. He floats on his bed high above LOWAS while he connects to Jade. Jade, who had woken up in her bed at the foot of the hill, returns to her house to find John setting up the equipment. John deploys the alchemiter and lathe in her greenhouse, and the cruxtruder in front of her fireplace. He opens the cruxtruder and discovers there are 10 minutes and 25 seconds until impact. They discuss what to prototype with, if anything. Rose warns him of the danger of failing to prototype, which would not allow the battlefield to heal, evolve to its final form, and grow the Tumor inside, which is critical to her plan to destroy the Green Sun. John resolves to prototype with the blue doll, missing an arm and an eye, to deliberately disable Jack. But Vriska puts him to sleep before he can. Becquerel then prototypes himself to destroy the meteor and save Jade. As he sleeps, John's ghost bed crashes into an oil ocean below. He loses his computer with the server disc in it, and nanna's pendant. He hops to a small island. He notices the ocean is on fire over the horizon, and the fire is approaching. He talks to Rose, who informs him Jade entered while he slept, and is safe. She tells him about a quest he'll need to go on later, to recover the Tumor from the battlefield and bring it to her. He then talks to Karkat, who is speaking to him for only the second time from Karkat's perspective. Karkat explains exactly what the kids did that made him decide to troll them. He blames Jade for prototyping Bec, creating Bec Noir who is now terrorizing the trolls' session, while blaming John for allowing it to happen. Meanwhile, the fire is approaching his island, and has turned green due to Bec Noir's transformation, taking place during a duel with bro and Davesprite elsewhere on LOWAS. John is contacted by Vriska, who admits to putting him in this position to challenge him, to realize his potential as the Heir of Breath. She also admits to deliberately playing a role in the creation of Bec Noir, wanting to be involved in his rise just as she also plans to be the one to kill him. She explains that regardless of her actions leading to his rise, his existence in the troll session is immutable. Due to the nature of paradox space, that outcome could not be changed with different actions. The only consequence of different actions would be an offshoot timeline, in which all participants would be doomed. As the fire surrounds him, she encourages him to use his abilities, and with some coaxing from WV who commands him from his station, he does the Windy Thing. The Breeze surrounds LOWAS and puts out the fire completely, and blows John to a larger landmass, just outside a village. The Breeze also clears the clouds from the sky, but they return shortly, as the spell over the planet must be broken by other means. By unlocking this ability, he reaches the top of the echeladder and becomes the Heir Transparent. Vriska then informs him the only thing left to do is reach the god tier, which is done by sleeping on his Quest Bed which is nearby. She tells him to ask the locals about it. He does, and finds the Quest Bed beyond the village. He sits in the bed but isn't tired. Vriska gives him the choice of whether he would like her to put him to sleep. He agrees. While he sleeps, Jack Noir finds him and stabs him through the chest, killing him. WV watches his death on the monitor and commands him to rise up. WV sees nothing except fireflies gather around John's body, while the Quest Bed glows. After the spectacle, there is no change. John's body remains motionless, and the monitor shuts off. WV believes John has died. And he is right. But on the battlefield, his dream self appears lying on a corresponding Quest Bed. His dream self slowly takes on the signs of the wound inflicted on his real self, as it rises. His dream self then takes over as his real self, with all wounds healed, as the fully realized Heir of Breath. WV?, pre-exile, watches this happen on the battlefield. He remembers this moment long after his exile, without understanding what transpired. But on Earth, WV believes he has just witnessed the end of John's quest. WV is still in possession of the ring, and has accidentally locked himself in the station, and there is not enough power to unlock it. The only source of power is a lump of uranium which he ate hours ago. So he waits. John now wanders the battlefield, poised to complete the objective he was given by Rose. EVENTS FROM ROSE'S PERSPECTIVE Rose uses her dark magic to search for ways to subvert the usual course of the game and overcome the futility of the situation, with assistance from her patron troll Kanaya, counsel from the gods of the Furthest Ring, and information provided by Doc Scratch. Kanaya begins trolling Rose suspecting her to be the author of the GameFAQ guide she read on Alternia, a figure she grew up idolizing. But she becomes disappointed with her due to a series of miscues resulting from her sporadic, nonlinear trolling. She continues conversing with her nonlinearly, engaging in a feud of snarky one-upmanship, gradually befriending her. She eventually realizes Rose is the true author of the guide when she watches her destroy the gate above her house with magic. She then continues helping her in a more linear fashion, uncovering the secrets of the game, and sharing her own extensive knowledge of the game with her. Ultimately, as Kanaya begins to understand the true nature of Rose's plan, she becomes afraid Rose is dangerous. She is especially unnerved by the fact that soon on Rose's timeline, her viewport goes dark, and she can no longer be monitored. But she acknowledges she can do nothing to stop her. So she trains Eridan to become a powerful white wizard of hope to challenge her, as a joke. A particular target of Rose's investigation is the Green Sun. She rips apart underground ruins to retrieve information on it, and is further informed by Doc Scratch on the subject. The Green Sun is a huge star nearly twice the mass of the universe. It resides somewhere in the Furthest Ring, and serves as the power source to all first guardians. Bec was Earth's first guardian, and when he became prototyped, Jack inherited all his powers, which are supplied by the Green Sun. Doc Scratch is the first guardian of Alternia. Doc Scratch, like Bec, is a virtually omnipotent being, with all the same powers. Unlike Bec, he is an intelligent host to those powers, and is therefore also omniscient. His job is to pave the way for the arrival of his employer, an indestructible time traveling demon called Lord English. Lord English can only enter a universe upon its death, at which point he travels back in time to an earlier point in the universe's lifespan to assume leadership of his gang of mobsters called The Felt. His machinations, like Scratch's, are in part designed to bring about his own future entrance. Before the trolls began their session, Scratch took measures to both pave the way for English to arrive, as well as contribute to his own creation. First guardians have circuitous self-fulfilling origins, much like the players of Sburb. Bec was created in a lab through ectobiology by merging the ghost slime image of grandpa's dog Harley with Rose's MEOW code. Scratch had a similar but yet unknown origin. Scratch manipulated several members of the trolls' party into playing Sburb (Sgrub) in the first place. Notably, he manipulated Vriska into killing Aradia, who as a ghost became the primary orchestrator of the session. He was also used as something of a pawn himself, by Terezi, in exacting revenge against Vriska, causing her to lose an eye and an arm. This was another key moment in a critical cycle of revenge, leading to Terezi's blindness and awakening, Vriska's eventual death by Aradia's retaliation, and then Vriska's resurrection to the god tier as the Thief of Light. Having done everything he needs to do, Scratch tells Rose he wishes to die. Thus the destruction of the Green Sun is to their mutual benefit, and Rose forms a plan. While she gave the short version of the plan to John, telling him he'd need to recover the Tumor, she tells the full plan to Dave. The Tumor at the center of the battlefield is in fact a very powerful bomb, capable of destroying the Green Sun. She will go to sleep, and John will bring it to her dream self. Meanwhile, Dave is to go to sleep and listen to the gods, who will tell him how to find the sun. He will make a map, and Rose will plot a course there and destroy the Green Sun in a suicide mission. Ideally, this will negate all of Jack's powers, reducing him to mortal status again. EVENTS FROM DAVE'S PERSPECTIVE After entering the gate above his apartment, Dave begins exploring LOHAC under the guidance of his patron troll, Terezi. Her fascination with him was prompted by the money wire from his future self, which alerted her to the existence of the humans in the first place. She watched him grow up with his bro, and made some observations about humanity through his upbringing. She then committed to helping him, in part due to her rivalry with Vriska, who sought to make sure the human she favored, John, would outpace Dave. Over the course of the adventures she coordinates for him, Dave experiences about 3 days chronologically due to looping through time, and fulfilling the requirements of various time loops. The key objective is to make enough money for him to be able to wire it to her in the first place, completing the time loop that started it all. The sum of money vastly exceeds what is typically gathered in a session, and it must be accumulated by manipulating the LOHAC Stock Exchange using time travel. Along the way, Dave and Terezi befriend each other, trading comics and perpetrating financial capers. In the early going, Terezi leads him into a pot of soup prepared by his crocodile consorts, for no particular reason other than it needed to happen on his timeline. Doubtful of the need for her help, he nearly quit, but received assurance from his future self, and continued exploring. He goes underground and discovers gold ruins. Before entering, he's interrupted by Karkat who uses a memo to warn both him and John about their involvement with Terezi and Vriska, telling them the scourge sisters are partaking in a dangerous game of rivalry fueled flirtation which has gotten both him and John killed at least once each. Karkat speaks from a time in which he's aware of a plan developing which may lead to the kids and trolls meeting each other, and does not look forward to the results of the gathering if these trends continue. John and Dave disregard his advice. Dave proceeds into the ruins and finds a legendary sword, Caledfwlch, lodged in a block of gold. He breaks it to retrieve it, and is told by Davesprite that the sword is critical to his personal quest as the Knight of Time. Terezi then tells him he is about to fall asleep, without knowing Vriska was behind this nap as well. Dave goes to sleep, and Davesprite defends him from a horde of powerful monsters. Before Dave wakes up, Davesprite leaves to find bro. He does, and joins him in battle against Jack. When Jade enters, Jack transforms into Bec Noir and defeats both of them. Bro is slain by his own sword, and the body is discovered by Dave later, who can't bring himself to retrieve the sword. While sleeping in the ruins, Dave's dream self wakes up again on Derse's moon. Following Rose's advice, he looks into the sky and takes off his shades. He gets his first glimpse of the gods. He then wakes up from hearing a gunshot fired by Jade as she battles an imp and quickly teleports away, the first of three times he sees her in this manner. He sees her again in the LOHACSE, and again while visiting Jade's planet. He then goes on to make all the money needed, to buy all the fraymotifs, which are powerful battle techniques purchased from consorts, and to reach the top of his echeladder. But he still wanted to know why he would never be able to reach John's level. To satisfy his curiosity, Terezi gives him a choice somewhere in the middle of his timeline, a choice to be decided by a coin flip. He could assign the outcome of the flip to mean he would either be shown now, or later. The outcome of the flip, which Terezi did not even look at, was a constant. Two realities are created by his two possible decisions. The decision to be shown now creates a doomed reality, wherein Dave becomes doomed. The decision to wait simply continues the alpha reality, and Dave remains the alpha Dave. Doomed Dave follows Terezi's instructions, given to him before the flip. He is to go back in time, leaving his doomed timeline, and sleep on his Quest Bed, and if he has what it takes to reach his god tier, he will. Alpha Dave, after waiting some time, was instructed to go to the bed to find sleeping Dave, and kill him, thus allowing him to face the true gravity of the decision. Dave doesn't go through with it, and decides to end his collaboration with Terezi for the time being. Later, doomed Dave wakes up, gets out of bed, and is immediately killed by Jack. 03:14 before the CRITICAL MOMENT, Terezi watches, and is upset by her involvement in his death. She runs off deeper into the lab. Dave travels to Jade's planet, the Land of Frost and Frogs (LOFAF). While standing in the snow, he sees Jade appear briefly while fighting an imp, just as he did before in the ruins. He contacts her, and she mentions she has lost track of John. Dave tells her John's busy, without mentioning he was in the process of rising to the god tier. He says John can no longer be her server player, and they would have to make other plans. Dave tells her to deploy the intellibeam laserstation in his apartment. The device allows very complex captcha codes for certain items, like a Sburb disc, to be read which couldn't otherwise be read by the human eye. He then creates a copy of his own server disc, and uses it to connect as Jade's server player. He becomes the server player for both Rose and Jade, though past Dave would stay concerned with Rose's connection, while he, as future Dave, would concern himself with Jade's connection. He deploys a new alchemiter and helps her upgrade it. With his massive reserve of grist accumulated in his travels and his more advanced torrenting capabilities, he allows Jade to alchemize some sophisticated equipment right away. A bit later, she contacts him again after learning of his dead bro, and dead doomed self. He assured her the dead Dave was just a doomed copy, and he would be fine. She decides Jack needs to be stopped, and they should come up with a better plan than Rose's suicide mission to stop him. He suggests the idea is futile, but lets her know she'd come to her own decision regardless, and he'd be available to talk later if needed. EVENTS FROM JADE'S PERSPECTIVE When Jade's dream self is killed, her robot explodes, destroying her room, causing her to fall. Bec transports her bed to break her fall. She falls asleep. Now dream dead, she has a dream in a bubble blown by a god in the Furthest Ring, and meets Feferi there. Feferi, a Derse dreamer, went to sleep to convince the gods to establish dream bubbles where they can meet while asleep, as long as their dream selves are dead. While she is asleep, 04:13 before the CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack destroys the trolls' Derse, killing her and all the Derse dreamers. She, along with all the other trolls and Jade, would then only dream in the Furthest Ring, where she met Jade and attempted to show her the gods were harmless. But Jade sees through the bubble and catches a glimpse of the gods. She wakes up with a headache, scared of what she saw, and resolves to stay awake. Feferi messages her, and introduces herself as the one from the dream. It is the second time they have spoken. The first time was long ago, from Jade's perspective. Jade realizes her robot has exploded, causing her to remember that was her cue to message Karkat. She does, and the aforementioned confusion takes place in the memo with past and future Karkat. Past Karkat berates her, while future Karkat defends her. She reprimands both of them for arguing with each other, who are the same person separated by only 3 hours. Dave enters the memo and mocks future Karkat for his flirtation with Jade after the lecture he gave to John and Dave on the subject. Jade ends the conversation, and is in no particular hurry to get back to him about the important matter he wanted to discuss. The meteor impact is imminent. John connects with her, and helps her prepare for entry. She makes her entry item from the pre-punched card. A tree sprouts from the alchemiter, and a green Bec-shaped pinata dangles from a branch. A green blindfold appears over her eyes, which she cannot remove. She attempts to strike the pinata with the butt of the rifle, which does no damage. Instead it releases a burst of energy, causing the greenhouse to explode, and Jade to fly out and fall. While falling, she takes a shot in the dark with her rifle. By this point, Bec has prototyped himself to become Becsprite, and has destroyed the meteor with a massive green energy blast, releasing a huge shockwave spreading over the surface of the Earth, destroying much of what hadn't been already by the meteor storm of the reckoning. Becsprite then appears in front of her bullet, and redirects it into the head of the pinata, destroying it. Jade, her house, and a large part of her island including the volcano, are all transported into the medium, on LOFAF. She falls through the snow of LOFAF, now unblindfolded. Becsprite again breaks her fall with a bed, and again she falls asleep. She has a recollection of sitting on her bed back on Earth some time ago, working on John's present. It's then that Feferi contacts her the first time. Jade believes she is trolling her like the others, but she only means to reassure her what happened wasn't her fault, as well as inform her of her plan to establish the dream bubbles. But soon, both realize this is not a memory, but a dream they are currently sharing, with the memory as a stage. Feferi meets Jade in her room and compliments her on her work on the bunny. Feferi also claims to be dead. Jade wakes up again, just as agitated as the first time she woke up. She gets out of bed and realizes her lunchtop is still in the destroyed greenhouse. She begins her ascent, but is interrupted by an encounter with an imp, which takes her on a trans-incipisphere journey, visiting many locations and passing by three instances of Dave, including a future Dave who ends up helping her later. The imp is finally killed by Becsprite. PM from post-apocalypse Earth, just after discovering her station and en route to the frog ruins, tries to issue commands to Jade through the terminal. Becsprite is alert to these commands, and protectively destroys PM's terminal. Jade returns and finds her computer undamaged. Future Dave contacts her after seeing her out in the snow. He then becomes her server player, and sets up her equipment after most of it was destroyed/transported before entry. As she prepares to alchemize new items, she is contacted by her "fairy god troll", a distinction which does not necessarily have anything to do with being a kid's patron troll. Tavros seeks permission from her to commune with Bec again. The first time he did it was when she was very young, and playing with her grandpa's flintlock pistols. She accidentally fired the gun at her self. Tavros communed with Bec to get him to transport the gun and the bullet away from her, and toward her grandpa who was picnicking with the blue doll, killing him. Tavros mistook him for an intruder, but regardless, Jade is upset by the revelation. He digs himself into a deeper hole by professing flushed feelings for her awkwardly, while making bold claims of high self esteem and confidence granted from his new robot legs. Put off by this, she is not particularly receptive to his plan to commune with Becsprite to take on Jack Noir, and ends the conversation. Vriska, who was reading the conversation, mocks Tavros for his false show of confidence. She continues to take jabs at him, calling him a coward, unable to do the one thing she asked which would have given him real confidence. She refers to the incident preceding her resurrection to the god tier. After she was nearly beaten to death by Aradia, Tavros finds her, believing her to be dead. He attempts to bring her back to life with a kiss. But having woken up on Prospit after the beating, Vriska's dream self is able to control his mind. She makes him choke himself, simply to prevent the kiss to avoid the standard resurrection process, which would prohibit god tier ascension. She does not wish to control him completely, intending to leave the following decisions to him, to make him stronger. Instead, she merely controls his hand to write messages to himself using her blood. She instructs him to take her to her Quest Cocoon, and to kill her on the sacrificial slab before she bleeds to death. He hesitates, and she continues to insist, while her dream self gradually takes on the same wounds inflicted on her real self, causing her demands to become more desperate. The more desperate she gets, the more terrified Tavros he becomes, and he finally flees without killing her. She eventually dies, and is resurrected on the battlefield as the Thief of Light. Still holding this against him, she berates him for his newfound attitude, and regards his plan to influence the kids' timeline as a cheap imitation of her tactics. She brags about the ways she has manipulated events on their timeline so far, by practicing her abilities on Jade repeatedly, causing her to fall asleep frequently. She describes ways in which she has inserted her agenda into existing events, tipping off agents to the whereabouts of the MEOW code book, and other such incidents which contributed to the rise of Jack Noir, so she could claim responsibility for his existence, before taking him on herself. Tavros becomes angry with her incessant mockery and the extent of her treachery, and decides to seek her out to challenge her. She waits for him somewhere in the lab. After the conversation with Tavros, Jade alchemizes a number of items. One of which is a legendary rifle, Ahab's Crosshairs, supplied by Eridan. Eridan, now believing himself to be a powerful wizard, feels he's surpassed the need for the weapon, and gives it to Jade to fuel the rivalry he mistakenly assumes she has with Rose, as payback for Rose's early dismissal of his black advances. Jade recognizes it as one of the weapons she included with the bunny for John. The weapons were provided by her penpal, who she accidentally revealed to be her grandson from the future. The pen pal swore her to secrecy on the matter, so she did the same with Eridan, though he admitted this would be the last time he talked to any human regardless. Realizing the new rifle would serve as a sort of heirloom to her grandson, she decided to discard it outside her house, and allow it to reach her grandson eventually however it may. Eridan then blew up her Johnnytop. Another item she created was a pair of junior compu-sooth spectagoggles, allowing her to see anything in the incipisphere at the present moment. She saw John as the Heir of Breath on the battlefield, Rose on LOHAC talking to Doc Scratch, Davesprite's pendant covered in blood nearby bro's dead body, and a slain doomed Dave. She contacts Dave to make sure he's alright. She then comes up with a plan to take on Jack Noir. She contacts Tavros again to talk about the plan he proposed, but he has left to take on Vriska. She has only one idea left. She goes up to her grandpa's lab, summons Becsprite, and tosses in her dead dream self, which her grandpa had retrieved from the battlefield and stuffed many years ago. Becsprite becomes Jadesprite. But dream Jade is not pleased by the transformation. She freaks out, and releases the typical first guardian pyrotechnics. The lab plummets, crushing the column and greenhouse below. It bounces away from the house, rolling into large snowball, and settling near a green stump. The two Jades sit in a state of dismay amidst the rubble of the lab, in the glow of a damaged 4th wall. As the clock ticks down to the CRITICAL EVENT, the most important character in Homestuck sits and watches this pandemonium ensue. And then, the second most important character in Homestuck positions a shitty drawing of himself in front of a typewriter and writes this recap. I think this typewriter is running out of ribbon ink. Thank God, that white ink is such a pain in the ass to read. Almost as much as these recaps are to write. How many of you here have personally witnessed a total eclipse of the sun? To stand one day in the shadow of the moon is one of my humble goals in life. The closest I ever came was over thirty years ago. On February 26, 1979, a solar eclipse passed directly over the city of Portland. I bought my bus tickets and found a place to stay. But in the end, I couldn‚Äôt get the time off work. Well, anyone who lives in Portland can tell you that the chances of catching the sun in February are pretty slim. And sure enough, the skies over the city that day were completely overcast. I wouldn‚Äôt have seen a thing. That work I couldn‚Äôt get out of was my first job out of college: A sales clerk at an old Radio Shack store in beautiful downtown Worcester, Massachusetts. On my very first day behind the counter, a delivery truck pulled up to the front of the store. They carried in a big carton, upon which was printed the legend TRS-80. It was our floor sample of the world‚Äôs first mass-market microcomputer. The TRS-80 Model I had a Z80 processor clocked at 1.7 megahertz, 4,096 bytes of memory, and a 64-character black-and-white text display. The only storage was a cassette recorder. All this could be yours for the low, low price of $599. This store I was working in had seen better days. At one time, it had been near the center of a thriving commercial district. But like so many other New England cities, the advent of shopping malls had, by the early ‚Äò70s, turned it into a ghost town. Worcester‚Äôs solution to this problem was decisive, to say the least. The city‚Äôs elders apparently decided that if they couldn‚Äôt beat them, they would join them. And so several square blocks at the heart of the city were bulldozed into oblivion, destroying dozens of family businesses, including the site of a pharmacy once operated by my great-grandfather. In their place was erected a vast three-level shopping complex, with cinemas and a food court. When the dust settled, only a few forlorn blocks of the old Worcester remained standing. My Radio Shack store was in one of those blocks. Then, to add insult to injury, Radio Shack opened a brand-new location inside the shopping center, less than 500 feet from my store. So now patrons has a choice between a clean, well-lighted establishment with uniformed security and acres of convenient parking, or a shadowy hole in a seedy old office building next to an adult movie theater. Consequently, I had plenty of time to fool around with the new computer. I taught myself BASIC programming. Then I learned Z80 assembly. Both, of course, so that I could write games. I also created self-running animated demos which ran all night in the store window for the edification of the winos who peed in our doorway. Strangely enough, the few customers we had didn‚Äôt seem to be interested in our new computer, even after the 16K memory upgrade. In fact, most of the people who set off the buzzer on their way through the front door weren‚Äôt there to buy anything at all. They were there to exploit a free promotion which was the bane of Radio Shack employees for over forty years: The Battery of the Month Club. The idea of this promotion was simple. Customers got a little red card upon which was printed a square for each month. Twelve times a year, the lucky sales clerk got to punch out a square and give the customer one brand new triple-A, double-A, C, D or 9-volt battery. Of course, customers weren‚Äôt allowed to choose just any grade of battery. At the time of my employment, Radio Shack offered three different levels of battery excellence. First were the alkalines, powerful, long-lasting and expensive, hanging behind the counter like prescription medication in gold-embossed blister packs. These were most certainly not available through the Battery of the Month Club. Next were the high-end lead batteries, sturdy, dependable batteries, moderately priced, and prominently displayed near the front of the store. These were also not available through the Battery of the Month Club. Finally, at the bottom of the barrel, were the standard lead batteries. These were literally piled in barrels, cunningly located way at the back of the store, in a dark corner near the TV antennas. Remember TV antennas? Customers who came in looking for their free Battery of the Month had to walk the entire length of the premises, past the CB radios and stereo headphones and remote-controlled racing cars. Nothing would stop them. On the first day of every month, like clockwork, those customers come in waving their little red cards. I would look up from my programming and wave them to the back of the store. It didn‚Äôt matter that the batteries were only worth twenty-nine cents. It didn‚Äôt matter that most of them were already half dead. They came. They grabbed. And, as far as I can remember, not one of them ever paid for a damned thing. I was such a crappy salesman. I was young and foolish. I thought my education in game design was happening at the keyboard. I almost missed the lesson coming through the front door. Fortunately, I wasn‚Äôt the only person fooling around with games on micros. All over the country, people like me were experimenting. Scott Adams was coding what would soon become the world‚Äôs first commercial adventure game. Remember adventure games? My future employer, Infocom, was being founded, along with other legendary companies like On-Line Systems, Sirius, Personal Software and SSI. Those were exciting times. Teenagers were making fortunes. Games were cheap and easy to build. The slate was clean. But in 1979, the biggest news in gaming had nothing to do with computers. ¬ß On the morning of the autumn equinox, September 20th, a new children‚Äôs picture book appeared in the stores of Great Britain. This picture book was rather peculiar. It consisted of 15 meticulously detailed color paintings, illustrating a slight, whimsical tale about a rabbit delivering a jewel to the moon. On the back jacket of the book was a color photograph of a real jewel shaped like a running rabbit, five inches long, fashioned of 18-karat gold, suspended with ornaments and bells, together with a sun and moon of blue quartz. According to the blurb underneath, this very jewel had been buried somewhere in England. Clues pointing to its location were concealed in the text and in the pictures of the book. The treasure would belong to whoever found it first. The book was called Masquerade. It was created by an eccentric little man with divergent eyes and a talent for mischief named Kit Williams. Within days, the first printing was sold out. And the Empire That Never Sleeps found itself in the grip of Rabbit Fever. Excited readers attacked the paintings with rulers, compasses and protractors. Magazine articles and TV specials dissected the clues, floated theories, and followed with keen delight the reckless exploits of the fanatics. One obscure park, unfortunately known by the nickname Rabbit Hill, was so riddled with holes excavated by misguided treasure seekers that the authorities had to erect signs assuring the public that no gold rabbits were to be found there. Some hunters ended up seeking psychological counseling for their obsession. The craze lept over the Atlantic Ocean and invaded America, France, Italy and Germany. It sold over a million copies in a few months, a record unrivalled by any children‚Äôs title until the advent of Harry Potter. Over 150,000 copies were sold in foreign translations, including 80,000 copies in Japanese, despite the fact that the puzzle was only solvable in English. It didn‚Äôt matter that the Masquerade jewel was only worth a few thousand dollars. Many seekers spent far more than that in their months of exploration and travel. It was the thrill of the chase. The possibility of being The One. Treasure hunts, secret messages and hidden things seem to exert an irresistible appeal. They‚Äôre fun to look for, and to talk about. And this fact of human psychology has been exploited in computer games since the earliest days. It finds expression in the hidden surprises we call Easter eggs. Atari‚Äôs Steven Wright is credited with coining this term in the first issue of Electronic Games magazine. The first Easter egg in a commercial computer game appeared in an early Atari 2600 cartridge called, simply enough, Adventure. By a sequence of unlikely movements and obscure manipulations, players could discover a secret room where the words ‚ÄúCreated by Warren Robinet‚Äù appeared in flashing letters. Over the decades, Easter eggs and their evil twin, cheat codes, have become an industry within an industry. Entire magazines and Web sites are now devoted to their carefully orchestrated discovery and dissemination. They‚Äôre part of our toolkit, our basic vocabulary, the language of computer game design. Computer gamers may have been the first to refer to hidden surprises as Easter eggs, but we certainly weren‚Äôt the first to use them. Painters, composers and artists of every discipline have been hiding stuff in their works for centuries. The recent advent of VCRs and laserdisc players with freeze-frame capability exposed decades of secret Disney erotica. Thomas Kinkade, the self-appointed ‚ÄúPainter of Light,‚Äù amuses himself by hiding the letter N in his works. A number beside his signature indicates how many Ns are hidden in each painting. Picasso, Dali, Raphael, Poussin and dozens of other painters concealed all kinds of stuff in their paintings. A favorite trick was hiding portraits of themselves, their families, friends and fellow artists in crowd scenes. El Greco loved dogs. But the Catholic Church forbid him from including any in his sacred paintings. So he hid them, usually within the outlines of celestial clouds. Composer Dmitri Shostakovich chafed under the political censorship imposed by the Soviet Ministry of Culture. His symphonies and chamber works are loaded with hidden signatures and subversive subtexts which, had they been recognized, would have sent him to Siberia. Mozart‚Äôs opera The Magic Flute is filled with musical allusions to the rituals of the Freemasons, the ancient secret society of which he and his mentor Haydn were members. But the most famous purveyor of Easter eggs is that champion of the late Baroque, the ultimate musical nerd, Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach was a student of gematria, the art of assigning numeric values to letters of the alphabet: A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. By comparing, sequencing or otherwise manipulating these numbers, secret messages can be concealed. Bach took particular delight in the gematriacal numbers 14 and 41. 14 is the sum of the initials of his last name: B=2, A=1, C=3 and H=8. 41 is the sum of his expanded initials, J S BACH. These two numbers show up over and over again in Bach‚Äôs compositions. One of the better-known examples is his setting of the chorale ‚ÄúVor deinen Thron.‚Äù The first line of the melody contains exactly 14 notes, and the entire melody from start to finish contains 41. Another of Bach‚Äôs favorite games was the puzzle canon. A canon is a melody that sounds good when you play it on top of itself, a little bit out of sync. ‚ÄúFreres Jacques‚Äù and ‚ÄúRow, Row, Row Your Boat‚Äù are familiar examples of simple, two-voice canons. But a canon can employ any number of voices. And you don‚Äôt have to play each voice the same way, either. You can change the octave, transpose the key, invert the pitch, play it backwards, or any combination. Finding melodies that make good multi-voice canons is a fussy and difficult art, of which Bach was an undisputed master. Now, in a puzzle canon, the composer specifies the basic melody and the number of voices, but not the relationship of the voices. The student has to figure out the position and key of each voice, and whether to perform them inverted and/or backwards. Bach wrote quite a number of puzzle canons. The most famous, BWV 1076, is part of a fascinating story. One of Bach‚Äôs students was a fellow by the name of Lorenz Mizler, founder of The Society of Musical Science. This elite, invitation-only institution devoted itself to the study of Pythagorean philosophy, and the union of music and mathematics. Its distinguished membership reads like a Who‚Äôs Who of German composers, including Handel, Telemann and eventually Mozart. Applicants for membership in the Society were required to submit an oil portrait of themselves, along with a specimen of original music. With nerdly efficiency, society member number 14 decided to combine these admission requirements into a single work. He sat for a portrait with Elias Haussmann, official artist at the court of Dresden. This portrait, which now hangs in the gallery of the Town Hall in Leipzig, is the only indisputably authentic image of Bach in existence. The Haussman portrait shows Bach dressed in a formal coat with exactly 14 buttons. In his hand is a sheet of music paper upon which is written a puzzle canon for six simultaneous voices. In 1974, a manuscript was discovered which proved that this canon was the thirteenth in a series of exactly 14 canons based on the ground theme of the famous Goldberg Variations. As if these musical gymnastics weren‚Äôt enough, Bach liked to hide messages in his compositions by assigning notes to the letters. His initials B-A-C-H correspond to the pitch sequence B-flat, A, C and B-natural in German letter notation. This theme makes its most memorable appearance in the last bars of his final composition, The Art of Fugue, published soon after his death in 1750. The word ‚Äúfugue‚Äù comes from the Latin fuga, which means flight (as in running away). So the art of fugue is the art of flight, the art of taking a theme and running with it. Bach wrote hundreds of fugues, but none as sublime as this sequence of 14. In the last and most complicated fugue in the series, the first and second sections develop normally. This is followed by the B-A-C-H signature, and then suddenly, without any warning or structural justification, the fugue stops dead in its tracks. One of the composer‚Äôs 20 children, his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, claimed that Bach died moments after those last few notes were written. This story is probably apocryphal. The Easter eggs in Bach‚Äôs music are a pleasant obscurity, known chiefly to professors and students of Baroque music. But in March of 2002, when this lecture was first delivered, those Easter eggs were the talk of the entire classical music industry. Sitting near the top of the classical music charts that month was a compact disc on the ECM label called Morimur. It is performed by the Hilliard choral ensemble together with a talented but, until then, little-known violinist, Christoph Poppen. The music on Morimur is based on a gematriacal analysis of Bach‚Äôs Partita in D Minor for solo violin. This analysis, by German professor Helga Thoene, assigns numeric values to the duration of notes, the number of bars, and the German letter notation of the Partita. In doing so, she claims to have discovered the complete text of several liturgical ceremonies encoded in the notes. The CD presents these hidden texts, superimposed over the original music. The result was strangely melancholy, dark, haunting, and very, very popular. Quite a few music critics attacked this disc. They didn‚Äôt buy Professor Thoene‚Äôs analysis, dismissing it as a combination of numerology and canny marketing. Their caution was not without basis. Numerology is a slippery slope down which many a fine mind has slid to its doom. Allow me to offer an amusing anecdote from my own experience. Back in the early ‚Äò90s, before the Internet took off, one of the more popular online bulletin board systems was a service called Prodigy. I bought an account on Prodigy so I could join a fraternal interest group, and gossip with fellow members around the country. One day, a stranger appeared on our bulletin board. Right away, I knew we were in trouble. This fellow, whose name was Gary, began spouting all kinds of apocalyptic nonsense about worldwide conspiracies, secret societies and devil worship. At first we tried to be polite. We questioned his sources, corrected his histories, logically refuted his claims, and tried to behave in a civilized manner. But instead of soothing him, our attention only made him worse. His conspiratorial warnings became urgent, approaching hysteria. He began to threaten people who disagreed with him. To coin a phrase, Gary went All Upper Case. But his most urgent warnings weren‚Äôt about the gays, the Jews, the Rockefellers or the Illuminati. According to Gary, the greatest enemy of mankind was Santa Claus. Gary claimed to possess a secret numerical formula that ‚Äúproved‚Äù beyond a shadow of a doubt that Santa Claus was an avatar of the Antichrist. Intrigued, we pressed Gary to reveal his formula. In doing so, we walked right into his trap. We should have known he had a book to sell. I fell for it. I sent him the fifteen bucks. Less than a week later the book arrived. Above an ominous photograph of the Washington monument was emblazoned the title: 666: The Final Warning! Inside this privately printed 494-page monster, Gary reveals a simple gematriacal formula which he claims was developed by the ancient Sumerians. This formula assigns successive products of 6 to each letter of the alphabet: A=6, B=12, C=18, etc. Imagine my dismay when I applied this ancient formula to the name ‚ÄúSanta Claus,‚Äù and obtained the blasphemous sum of 666, the Biblical Number of the Beast! I went on Prodigy and reported to the stunned members of our interest group that Gary was right, after all. There could be no doubt that, according to the unimpeachable wisdom of ancient Sumeria, Santa Claus was the AntiChrist. I then went on to point out several other names which, when submitted to Gary‚Äôs formula, also produced the sum 666. Names like ‚ÄúSaint James,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Mexico.‚Äù Soon the bulletin board was filled with discoveries like ‚Äúcomputer,‚Äù ‚ÄúBoston tea‚Äù and, most sinister of all, ‚Äúsing karaoke.‚Äù Gary left us alone after that. I got my $15 worth. But Gary is hardly the first person to connect secret codes to the Bible. People have been looking for Easter eggs in the Bible for hundreds of years. The Hebrew mystical tradition of kabbalah can be described as a gematriacal meditation on the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament. The advent of computers has made the application of numerology to the Bible fast and efficient. The latest spate of Bible-searching was instigated by a book published in 1998 by Michael Drosnin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. His book, The Bible Code, applied a skip-cypher, in which every nth character in a text is combined to form a message. By applying his skip-cypher to the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, Drosnin claimed to have discovered predictions of World War II, the Holocaust, Hiroshima, the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and both Kennedys, the moon landing, Watergate, the Oklahoma City bombing, the election of Bill Clinton, the death of Princess Di and the comet that collided with Jupiter. He also found predictions of a giant earthquake in LA, a meteor hitting the earth, and nuclear armageddon, all scheduled to occur before the end of the last decade. The Bible Code spent many weeks on the bestseller lists, spawning several sequels and dozens of imitators. The Bible has certainly attracted its share of crackpots. But for the real hardcore egg hunters, nothing can rival the ingenuity, the tenacious scholarship, the stubborn zeal of those who seek the answer to the ultimate literary puzzle. A poisonous conundrum that has squandered fortunes, destroyed careers, and driven healthy, intelligent scholars to the brink of madness, and beyond. Who wrote Shakespeare? ¬ß The essays and books devoted to the Shakespeare authorship problem are sufficient to fill a large library. Several such libraries actually exist. Not even a day-long tutorial, much less an hour lecture, can begin to do justice to this complex, bizarre and dangerously tantalizing story. Nevertheless, for the unacquainted, I will attempt to summarize the issue in a few paragraphs. The undisputed facts of Shakespeare‚Äôs life and career could be scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin. We know for a fact that a man named William Shakespeare was born in 1564 in or around the village of Stratford-upon-Avon. We know that he had a wife and at least three children. We know he bought property in Stratford, was involved in several lawsuits with his neighbors, and died there in 1616, aged 52. We also know that during those same years, a man with a last name similar to Shakespeare worked as an actor on the London stage, eventually becoming co-owner of some of the theaters there. We also know that, about the same time, a number of most excellent poems and plays were published in London under the name Shakespeare. We do not know for a fact that the landowner in Stratford and the actor in London with a similar last name were one and the same man. We do not know for a fact that either man had anything to do with the poems and the plays. All we know is that those poems and plays have, in the four hundred years since their composition, come to be regarded as a pinnacle of Western culture. The works attributed to Shakespeare appear to have been written by a man or woman who knew something about just about everything. They‚Äôre filled with references to mythology and classic literature, games and sports, war and weapons of war, ships and sailing, the law and legal terminology, court etiquette, statesmanship, horticulture, music, astronomy, medicine, falconry and, of course, theater. Therein lies the problem. How could a farmer‚Äôs son of uncertain schooling from a mostly illiterate country village, a man of practically no account at all, wield such encyclopedic learning with so much eloquence and wit, so much wisdom and human understanding? For the first 150 years, nobody questioned the traditional history of the Bard. Then, in the late eighteenth century, Reverend James Wilmot, a distinguished scholar who lived just a few miles north of Stratford, decided to write a biography of the famous playwright. Dr. Wilmot believed that a man as well-educated as Shakespeare must have owned a fairly extensive library, despite the fact that not a single book or manuscript is mentioned in his will. Over the years, he speculated, some of those books must have found their way into local collections. And so the good Reverend Doctor scoured the British countryside, taking inventory of literally every bookshelf within 50 miles of Stratford. Not a single book from the library of William Shakespeare was discovered. Neither were there found any letters to, from or about Shakespeare. Furthermore, no references to the folklore, local sayings or distinctive dialect of the Stratford area could be found in any of Shakespeare‚Äôs writings. After four years of painstaking research, Dr. Wilmot concluded, to his own dismay, that only one person contemporary with Shakespeare of Stratford had ever demonstrated the wide-ranging education and expressive talent needed to compose those poems and plays. That man was the multilingual author, philosopher and statesman, inventor of the Scientific Method, Chancellor to the Courts of Queen Elizabeth and King James, Sir Francis Bacon. Dr. Wilmot never dared to publish his theory. But before he died he confided it to a friend, James Cowell, who, in 1805, repeated it to a meeting of the Ipswich Philosophical Society. The members of the society were suitably outraged, and the scandalous matter was quickly forgotten. Then in 1857, a lady from Stratford -- Stratford, Connecticut -- published a book called The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded. In this book, Miss Delia Bacon, no relation to Francis, claimed that the works of Shakespeare were written by a secret cabal of British nobility including Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Philip Sidney as well as Sir Francis Bacon. Delia Bacon‚Äôs book electrified the world of letters. Battle lines were drawn between the orthodox Stratfordians and the heretical Baconians. Literary societies and scholarly journals were formed to debate the evidence. Hundreds of pamphlets, newspaper articles and essays were published defending each side, and ridiculing the opposition with that self-aggrandizing viciousness peculiar to tenured academics. Armed with her explosive book, Delia Bacon journeyed to Stratford-upon-Avon and, unbelievably, obtained official permission to open Shakespeare‚Äôs grave. However, when the moment came to actually lift the stone, Delia‚Äôs self-doubt precipitated a catastrophic nervous breakdown. She later died penniless in a madhouse. Around 1888, things began to get a bit out of hand. U. S. Congressman Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota became interested in the Shakespeare controversy. One day, browsing through his facsimile copy of the First Folio of 1623, he noted that the word ‚Äúbacon‚Äù appeared on page 53 of the Histories and also on page 53 of the Comedies. He also noted that Sir Francis Bacon had written extensively on the subject of cryptography. Donnelly began counting line and page numbers, adding and subtracting letters, drawing lines over sentences, circling words and crossing them out. The result was a complex and virtually incomprehensible algorithm which he claimed was invented by Bacon to hide secret messages inside the First Folio. The greatest Easter egg hunt in the history of Western civilization had begun. Here are just a couple of the sillier highlights. A doctor named Orville Owen of Detroit constructed a bizarre research tool he called the Wheel of Fortune. This wheel consisted of two giant wooden spools wrapped with a strip of canvas two feet wide and a thousand feet long. Onto this canvas he glued the separate pages of the complete works of Bacon, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Greene, Peele and Spenser, together with Burton‚Äôs Anatomy of Melancholy. By cranking the spools back and forth, Dr. Owen could quickly zip across the pages in search of clues and cross-references. Employing a large team of secretaries and stenographers, Owen claimed to have uncovered a complete alternative history of Elizabethan England, as well as several entirely new Shakespeare plays and sonnets. Listen to this hidden verse, supposedly penned by the mighty Bard himself, which inspired Dr. Owen to build his Wheel of Fortune. Take your knife and cut all our books asunderAnd set the leaves on a great firm wheelWhich rolls and rolls, and turning the fickle rolling wheelThrow your eyes upon FortuneThat goddess blind, that stands upon a spherical stonethat, turning and inconstant, rollsin restless variation. After publishing five thick volumes of this rubbish, Owen announced the discovery of an anagram indicating that Bacon‚Äôs original manuscripts were buried near Chepstow Castle on the river Wye. Owen spent the next fifteen years and thousands of dollars excavating the bed of the river with boat crews and high explosives. He died before anything was found. A fellow named Arensberg wrote an entire book based on the analysis of the significance of a suspicious crack in the tomb of Bacon‚Äôs mother. A ray of sanity finally appeared in 1957. To those familiar with the science of cryptology, the name William Friedman needs little introduction. During World War II , Colonel Friedman was the head of the US Army‚Äôs cryptoanalytic bureau. He is credited with cracking the Japanese Empire‚Äôs most sensitive cipher. After the war, the Colonel decided to apply his expertise to the study of the Shakespeare ciphers. He interviewed several of the experts in the field, and prepared a detailed scientific analysis, which he published under the title The Shakespeare Ciphers Examined. His conclusion? In a word, bunk. According to the standards of cryptologic science, not one of the hidden messages purportedly discovered in Shakespeare‚Äôs works was plausible. The rules used to extract these messages from the texts were non-rigorous, wildly subjective, and unrepeatable by anyone except the original decypherer. The people involved were not being dishonest. They were channeling their preconceptions. They were trapped in a labyrinth of delusion, mining order from chaos. ‚ÄúAngler[s] in a lake of darkness.‚Äù Lear III.6. You would think that Friedman‚Äôs cold and ruthless exposure would be enough to silence the heretics once and for all. Not a chance. The books and TV specials and Web sites and conferences and doctoral dissertations keep right on coming. I should point out that the Shakespeare authorship issue is not only the preoccupation of cranks and weirdos. A substantial number of respected authors and Shakespeareans have expressed serious doubts about the traditional origin of the plays. The list includes Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Sam Clemens, Sigmund Freud, Orson Welles and Sir John Gielgud. Living skeptics include the artistic director of the New Globe Theater, Mark Rylance; Michael York, Derek Jacobi, Kenneth Branagh, and even that most revered and scholarly of contemporary Shakespearean actors, Keanu Reeves. The current leading candidate for the authorship is Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, a theory first proposed in 1920 by an English schoolmaster with the unfortunate name J. Thomas Looney. What is it about Bach, the Bible and the works of Shakespeare that inspires this intense scrutiny? Nobody‚Äôs looking for acrostics in Chaucer or Keats. There are no hit CDs of the secret chorales of Wagner or Beethoven. For the answer, we need to recognize the unique roles which the Bible and Shakespeare have played in the development of Western culture. No other single work of literature has influenced Modern English more than the translation of the Holy Bible published in 1611 under the auspices of King James I. The King James Bible exemplifies the meaning of the word classic. It has been called the noblest monument of English prose, the very greatest achievement of the English language. It has served as an inspiration for generations of poets, dramatists, musicians, politicians and orators. Countless people have learned to read by repeating the phrases in this, the only book their family possessed. Our constitutions and our laws have been profoundly shaped by its cadences and imagery. But even the glory of the King James Bible, compiled by a committee of 46 editors over the course of a decade, pales before the dazzling legacy of the Swan of Avon. The lowest estimate of Shakespeare‚Äôs working vocabulary is 15,000 words, more than three times that of the King James Bible, and twice the size of his nearest competitor, John Milton. His poems and plays were written without the aid of a dictionary or a thesaurus. They didn‚Äôt exist yet. It was all in his head. When Shakespeare had a thought for which Elizabethan English had no word, he invented one. The Oxford English Dictionary lists hundreds of everyday words and phrases which made their first appearance in the pages of the Bard. Addiction. Alligator. Assasination. Bedroom. Critic. Dawn. Design. Dialogue. Employer. Film. Glow. Gloomy. Gossip. Hint. Hurry. Investment. Lonely. Luggage. Manager. Switch. Torture. Transcendence. Wormhole. Zany. Hamlet alone contains nearly forty of these neologisms. Who today would have this audacity, this giddy exuberance of invention? Only one other English author even approaches Shakespeare‚Äôs facility for coining new words: Sir Francis Bacon. In the modern era, the record holder is Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, who, interestingly, also happens to be the second most quoted author in English, after Shakespeare. Everyone has been profoundly molded by the influence of the King James Bible and Shakespeare. Like it or not, all of us peer at the world through the lenses of these great works. They are the primary source documents of modern English thought, the style guides of our minds. Contemplating these dazzling jewels of wisdom and eloquence gives rise to an extraordinary feeling. A potent, rare and precious emotion with the potential to completely upset your life. An emotion powerful enough to make a man abandon his wife and children, forfeit career and reputation, lay down his possessions and follow his heart without questioning. That sweet, sweet fusion of wonder and fear, irresistible attraction and soul-numbing dread known as awe. Awe is the Grail of artistic achievement. No other human emotion possesses such raw transformative power, and none is more difficult to evoke. Few and far between are the works of man that qualify as truly awesome. It is awe that convinces a rabbi to spend a lifetime decoding Yahweh from the Pentateuch. Awe that sends millions of visitors each year to the Pyramids of Giza, Guadalupe and Mecca. It was awe that drove poor Delia Bacon to her doom. Now, please don‚Äôt come away from this lecture thinking that the key to awesome game design is the installation of Easter eggs! Ordinary games, with their contrived Easter eggs and cheat codes, are like the Battery of the Month club. You have to trudge down to the back of the store to get what you really came for. If super power is what people really want, why not just give it to them? Is our imagination so impoverished that we have to resort to marketing gimmicks to keep players interested in our games? Awesome things don‚Äôt hold anything back. Awesome things are rich and generous. The treasure is right there. One afternoon, I was sitting alone behind the counter at that old Radio Shack store. My boss had stepped out for some reason. An elderly woman walked through the front door. Like most of our customers, she was shabbily dressed. Probably on a fixed income. I assumed she was there for her free battery. But instead, she placed a portable radio on the counter. This radio came from the days when they boasted about the number of transitors inside on the case. It was completely wrapped in dirty white medical tape. The woman looked at me, and asked, ‚ÄúCan you fix this?‚Äù Slowly I unwrapped the medical tape, peeling away the layers until the back cover of the radio fell off, accompanied by a cloud of red dust. The interior of the radio was half eaten away by battery leakage and corrosion. I looked at the radio. I looked at the old woman. I looked back at the radio. I reached behind me, where the expensive alkaline batteries were hanging like prescription medication, and removed a gleaming nine-volt cell from its gold blister pack. Then I pulled a brand-new transistor radio from a box, installed the alkaline and helped the lady find her favorite station. No money changed hands. She left the store without saying a word. Awesome things are kind of like that. Bach offered his students very specific insight into the source of awe. In addition to B-A-C-H, two other sets of initials are also associated with Bach‚Äôs music. These initials are not hidden in the notes. Instead, they‚Äôre scrawled right across the top of his manuscripts for the whole world to see. The initials are SDG and JJ. SDG stands for the Latin phrase Soli Deo Gloria, ‚ÄúTo the glory of God alone.‚Äù JJ stands for Jesu Juva, ‚ÄúHelp me, Jesus.‚Äù Bach wrote all of his great masterpieces sub specie aeternitatis, ‚Äúunder the aspect of eternity.‚Äù He did not compose only to please his sponsors, or to win the approval of an audience. His work was his worship. Bach once wrote, ‚ÄúMusic should have no other end and aim than the glory of God and the recreation of the soul. Where this is not kept in mind there is no true music, but only an infernal clamour and ranting.‚Äù The name of the power that moves you is not important. What is important is that you are moved. Awe is the foundation of religion. No other motivation can free you from the limits of personal achievement. Nothing else can teach you the Art of Flight. Computer games are barely forty years old. Only a few words in our basic vocabulary have been established. A whole dictionary is waiting to be coined. The slate is clean. Someday soon, perhaps even in our lifetime, a game design will appear that will flash across our culture like lightning. It will be easy to recognize. It will be generous, giddy with exuberant inventiveness. Scholars will pick it apart for decades, perhaps centuries. It will be something wonderful. Something terrifying. Something awe-full. A few years ago I was invited to speak at a conference in London. My wife joined me, and we took a day off for some sightseeing. We decided to visit England‚Äôs second-biggest tourist attraction, Stratford-upon-Avon. It was cold and rainy when our train arrived. Luckily, most of the attractions are just a short walk from the station. We visited Shakespeare‚Äôs birthplace, a charming old house along the main street which attracts millions of pilgrims every year, despite the complete lack of any evidence of Shakespeare ever having lived there. We went past the school where Shakespeare learned to read and write, although no documents exist to prove his attendance. We visited Anne Hathaway‚Äôs cottage, the rustic country farm where his wife spent her childhood, although no record shows anyone by that name ever having living there. Finally we came to the one location undeniably associated with Shakespeare: Trinity Parish church, on the banks of the river Avon, where a man by that name is buried. This beautiful church is approached by a long walkway, between rows of ancient gravestones, shaded by tall trees. The entrance door is surprisingly tiny. No cameras are allowed inside. The interior is dark and quiet. Despite the presence of busloads of tourists, the atmosphere is hushed and respectful. A few people are seated in the pews, deep in prayer. An aisle leads up the center of the church. The left side of the altar is brightly illuminated. On the wall above is a famous bust of the Bard, quill in hand, gazing serenely at the crowd of pilgrims. On the floor beneath, surrounded by bouquets of flowers, at the very spot where Delia Bacon lost her mind, the gravestone of William Shakespeare bears this dire warning: Good friend for Jesus‚Äô sake forbearTo dig the dust enclosed hereBlest be the man who spares these stonesAnd curst be he that moves my bones. Every year, three million pilgrims arrive from every nation on Earth to approach this stone and consider the likeness of a man whose body of work can only be described as awesome. By contrast, the right side of the altar is dark and featureless. Nobody of any consequence is buried there. The only point of interest is a wooden case, of simple design, carved of dark oak. Inside the case, sealed beneath a thick sheet of glass, lies a large open book. A plaque on the case identifies this book as a first edition of the King James Bible, published in 1611, when Shakespeare was forty-six. Not many pilgrims visit this side of the altar. Most of those that do simply glance at the book, read the plaque and move along. A few, more observant, note that the Bible happens to be opened to a page in the Old Testament: the Book of Psalms, chapter 46. No explanation is given for this particular choice of pages. For the initiated, none is necessary. If you are of inquisitive bent, if you are intrigued by English history and literature, if you value your peace of mind, cover your ears, now. In the year 1900, a scholar noticed something about the King James translation of Psalm 46. Something terrifying. Something wonderful. The 46th word from the beginning of Psalm 46 is ‚Äúshake.‚Äù The 46th word from the end is ‚Äúspear.‚Äù There are only two possibilities here. Either this is the finest coincidence ever recorded in the history of world literature. Or, it is not. ¬ß The Earth revolves around only one sun, and has only one moon. The moon happens to be four hundred times smaller than the sun. The sun happens to be four hundred times farther away. And the apparent paths of the moon and sun in our sky happen to intersect exactly twice every month. Which means that every now and then, at long yet precisely predictable intervals, the lunar disc slips across the face of the sun and just barely conceals it for a few wonderful, terrible minutes. A fine coincidence, no? ¬ß In June of 1977, a little man with divergent eyes and a talent for mischief ascended a hilltop in the British village of Ampthill. At the summit of this hill is a tall, slender cross, a memorial to Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII. The sun, high in the south, cast the shadow of the cross upon the grassy hillside. At exactly 12 noon, the man removed from his pocket a bar magnet. He turned the magnet so its north pole was facing south, and buried it under the shadow of the cross. Two years later, a few hours before the publication of his first book, the man returned to that hillside, this time in the dead of night. He used a compass to locate the magnet he had buried. In that same place, he dug a hole in the ground and placed inside a ceramic container inscribed with the following words: ‚ÄúI am the Keeper of the Jewel of MASQUERADE, which lies waiting safe inside me for You or Eternity.‚Äù s Heeeeeeeyyy!!I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself. That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children. You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up. But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away. However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me. Haaahhh... haaahhh... I overslept again! s But I caught you this time! mc Maybe, but only because I decided to stop and wait for you. sEeehhhhh, you say that like you were thinking about ignoring me! s That's mean, [player]! mc Well, if people stare at you for acting weird then I don't want them to think we're a couple or something. Fine, fine. But you did wait for me, after all. I guess you don't have it in you to be mean even if you want to~ mc Whatever you say, Sayori... Ehehe~ We cross the street together and make our way to school. As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute. By the way, [player]... Have you decided on a club to join yet? mc A club? mc I told you already, I'm really not interested in joining any clubs. mc I haven't been looking, either. Eh? That's not true! s You told me you would join a club this year! mc Did I...?I'm sure it's possible that I did, in one of our many conversations where I dismissively go along with whatever she's going on about. Sayori likes to worry a little too much about me, when I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime. Uh-huh! s I was talking about how I'm worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before college. Your happiness is really important to me, you know! s And I know you're happy now, but I'd die at the thought of you becoming a NEET in a few years because you're not used to the real world! s You trust me, right? s Don't make me keep worrying about you... mc Alright, alright... mc I'll look at a few clubs if it makes you happy. mc No promises, though. Will you at least promise me you'll try a little? mc Yeah, I guess I'll promise you that. Yaay~! Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl? More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her. I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head. The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it. After I pack up my things, I stare blankly at the wall, looking for an ounce of motivation. mc Clubs... Sayori wants me to check out some clubs. I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club... Hellooo? mc Sayori...?Sayori must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out. I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom. I thought I'd catch you coming out of the classroom, but I saw you just sitting here and spacing out, so I came in. Honestly, you're even worse than me sometimes... I'm impressed! mc You don't need to wait up for me if it's going to make you late to your own club. Well, I thought you might need some encouragement, so I thought, you know... mc Know what? s Well, that you could come to my club! mc Sayori... Yeah?? mc ... There is no way I'm going to your club. Eeeehhhhh?! Meanie!Sayori is vice president of the Literature Club. Not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature. In fact, I'm 99\% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club. Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title Vice President. That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less. mc Yeah. I'm going to the anime club. C'mon, please? mc Why do you care so much, anyway? s Well... I kind of told the club yesterday I would bring in a new member... And Natsuki made cupcakes and everything... Ehehe... mc Don't make promises you can't keep!I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out. I let out a long sigh. mc Fine... I'll stop by for a cupcake, okay? s Yes! Let's go~! And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul for a cupcake. I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities. Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door. Everyone! The new member is here~! mc I told you, don't call me a 'new member--' Eh? I glance around the room. Welcome to the Literature Club. It's a pleasure meeting you. Sayori always says nice things about you. Seriously? You brought a boy? n Way to kill the atmosphere. Ah, [player]! What a nice surprise! m Welcome to the club! mc ... All words escape me in this situation. This club... ... is full of incredibly cute girls!! n What are you looking at? n If you want to say something, say it. mc S-Sorry... Natsuki... 5s Hmph. The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize. Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year. She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori. You can just ignore her when she gets moody~Sayori says that quietly into my ear, then turns back toward the other girls. Anyway! This is Natsuki, always full of energy. And this is Yuri, the smartest in the club! y D-Don't say things like that... Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki. mc Ah... Well, it's nice to meet both of you. And it sounds like you already know Monika, is that right? m That's right. It's great to see you again, [player]. Monika smiles sweetly. We do know each other well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year. Monika was probably the most popular girl in class smart, beautiful, athletic. Basically, completely out of my league. So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little... mc Y-You too, Monika. Come sit down, [player]! We made room for you at the table, so you can sit next to me or Monika. I'll get the cupcakes~ n Hey! I made them, I'll get them! s Sorry, I got a little too excited~ y Then, how about I make some tea as well?The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table. As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori. Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet. Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori. Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand. Okaaay, are you ready? n ... Ta-daa! s Uwooooah!Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats. The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears. So cuuuute~! m I had no idea you were so good at baking, Natsuki! n Ehehe. Well, you know. Just hurry and take one!Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow. It's delicious!Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face. I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite. Natsuki is quiet. I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction. Is she waiting for me to take a bite?I finally bite down. The icing is sweet and full of flavor I wonder if she made it herself. mc This is really good. mc Thank you, Natsuki. W-Why are you thanking me? It's not like I...!(Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?) n ... Made them for you or anything. mc Eh? I thought you technically did. Sayori said-- n Well, maybe! n But not for, y-you know, you! Dummy... mc Alright, alright... I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation. Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set. She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray. mc You keep a whole tea set in this classroom? y Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission. After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book? mc Ah... I-I guess... Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you. Eh?! T-That's not... Insulted, Yuri looks away. I meant that, you know... mc I believe you. mc Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea. I'm glad... Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief. Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me. So, what made you consider the Literature Club? mc Um... I was afraid of this question. Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori. mc Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so... That's okay! Don't be embarrassed! m We'll make sure you feel right at home, okay? m As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone! mc Monika, I'm surprised. mc How come you decided to start your own club? mc You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs. mc Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year? m Ahaha, well, you know... To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs. It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events... I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it. And if it encourages others to get into literature, then I'm fulfilling that dream! s Monika really is a great leader! Yuri also nods in agreement. mc Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet. mc It must be hard to start a new club. You could put it that way. Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new... Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature. You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile. But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important. I'm confident that we can all really grow this club before we graduate! m Right, everyone? s Yeah! y We'll do our best. You know it!Everyone enthusiastically agrees. Such different girls, all interested in the same goal... Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three. Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining. Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature... So, [player], what kinds of things do you like to read? mc Well... Ah... Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that. mc ... Manga... I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking. Natsuki's head suddenly perks up. It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet. 3u N-Not much of a reader, I guess... mc ... Well, that can change... What am I saying?I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile. mc Anyway, what about you, Yuri? y Well, let's see... Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger. My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds. The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me. And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive. Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading. She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people. But you know, I like a lot of things. Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well. Isn't it amazing how a writer can so deliberately take advantage of your own lack of imagination to completely throw you for a loop? y Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately... mc Ah, I read a horror book once... I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level. At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock. Really? I wouldn't have expected that, Yuri. For someone as gentle as you... I guess you could say that. But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down. Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment. Ugh, I hate horror... 1f Oh? Why's that? n 5c Well, I just... Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second. 5q Never mind. That's right, you usually like to write about cute things, don't you, Natsuki? n W-What? n What gives you that idea? m You left a piece of scrap paper behind last club meeting. It looked like you were working on a poem called-- n Don't say it out loud!! n And give that back! m Fine, fine~ s Ehehe, your cupcakes, your poems... Everything you do is just as cute as you are~Sayori sidles up behind Natsuki and puts her hands on her shoulders. I'm not cute!! mc Natsuki, you write your own poems? n Eh? Well, I guess sometimes. Why do you care? mc I think that's impressive. mc Why don't you share them sometime? n N-No!Natsuki averts her eyes. You wouldn't... like them... mc Ah... not a very confident writer yet? y I understand how Natsuki feels. Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence. The truest form of writing is writing to oneself. You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart. Do you have writing experience too, Yuri? m Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers. ... mc I guess it's the same for Yuri... show sayori 2g at t32 zorder 2 s Aww... I wanted to read everyone's poems... We all sit in silence for a moment. Okay! m I have an idea, everyone~ n&y ...?Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika. Let's all go home and write a poem of our own! m Then, next time we meet, we'll all share them with each other. That way, everyone is even! n U-Um... ... Yeaaah! Let's do it! m Plus, now that we have a new member, I think it will help us all get a little more comfortable with each other, and strengthen the bond of the club. Isn't that right, [player]?Monika smiles warmly at me once again. mc Hold on... there's still one problem. Eh? What's that?Now that we're back to the original topic of me joining the club, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time. mc I never said I would join this club! mc Sayori may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision. mc I still have other clubs to look at, and... um... I lose my train of thought. All four girls stare back at me with dejected eyes. B-But... I'm sorry, I thought... Hmph. [player]... mc Y-You all... I... I'm defenseless against these girls. How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this?That is, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls... mc ... Right. mc Okay, I've decided, then. mc I'll join the Literature Club. One by one, the girls' eyes light up. Yesss! I'm so happyyy~Sayori wraps her arms around me, jumping up and down. mc H-Hey-- y You really did scare me for a moment... If you really just came for the cupcakes, I would be super pissed. Then that makes it official! m Welcome to the Literature Club! mc Ah... thanks, I guess. Okay, everyone! m I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note. Everyone remember tonight's assignment: m Write a poem to bring to the next meeting, so we can all share!Monika looks over at me once more. [player], I look forward to seeing how you express yourself. Ehehe~ mc Y-Yeah... Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills?I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me. Meanwhile, the girls continue to chit-chat as Yuri and Natsuki clean up their food. Hey, [player], since we're already here, do you want to walk home together?That's right Sayori and I never walk home together anymore because she always stayed after school for clubs. mc Sure, might as well. Yaay~ With that, the two of us depart the clubroom and make our way home. The whole way, my mind wanders back and forth between the four girls: Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and, of course, Monika. Will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature club?Perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls... Alright!I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances, and I'm sure good fortune will find me. And I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight... OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY IS THIS SUBREDDIT SO FUCKING HORNY FOR FUCKING FEMBOYS!! I GO ON TO REDDIT AND SIT DOWN EXPECTING TO SEE FUNNY MEMES BUT NO IT'S JUST FEMBOYS!

Go off the grid, only leaving your man cave for groceries. One day, you let loose a bit and decide to go to McDonald‚Äôs. You shit yourself while in queue, and someone records it. You are no longer anonymous, you are the McDonald‚Äôs lineshit bandit. And you will have your vengeance Cock and ball torture (CBT), penis torture or dick torture, is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lil Pump. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Lil Pump's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lil Pump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lil Pump's existential catchphrase "ESKITIT", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lil Pump's musical genius unfolds itself. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Lil Pump tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only And even they have to demonstrate that they're within five IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Excuse me... is this some kind of pathetic joke? I can't even wrap my head around how a fully functioning human being could produce something so vile and disgusting. This is TERRIBLE. YOU are terrible. This pathetic abomination is so purely awful and painful to even know about, that even all the mass murderers and rapists that exist on this planet would invert their bodies into themselves in shame and horror and unspeakable pain at what they just witnessed. It would take triple the lifespan of the universe for the most brilliant minds in the world to concoct such an utterly terrible, unspeakable, and overwhelmingly depressing creation; nay, a WAR CRIME no, no... a UNIVERSAL ATROCITY arisen STRAIGHT FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL. Even thinking about the disgusting, heartrending, boiling soup of all the worst parts of humanity... it makes me lose the will to even live. It makes me think that maybe the complete and utter extinction event that could be complete nuclear warfare upon humanity isn't so bad after all. I can FEEL my brain cells shriveling up and dying like a dead leaf that crumbles apart when you touch it. My very SOUL is fading away as we speak, just because this wretched, disgusting, vile abomination even EXISTS. I would rather be hung from the tip of Mount Everest by my ballsack while in the middle of an acid rain hurricane while being slowly eaten by dog-sized maggots than ever think about this abhorrent and destructive sub-human abomination ever again. Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who‚Äôs soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. I wanna fuck the amogus imposter, damn it's so fucking hot I just can't take it anymore I have seen every r34 and porn cosplay of amogus imposter but it doesn't make me feel happy anymore because I know amogus imposter deserves all the cum I have wasted on its hentai, I wanna impregnate him and hear him whisper into my ear "that's a bit sussy" oh fuck oh god amogus imposter why are you not real fuck fuck fuck I wanna fuck it so damn bad but it's not real help please help me make amogus imposter real My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway. If you angerly masturbate to another guy's money and jizz in your mouth and compliment yourself for the taste when you're on your shift at work, then you've committed all 7 sins... with room to spare.

Shrek 2 Script [man's voice] Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming. [horse whinnies] It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep. [crows caw] For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [gasps] What? Princess... Fiona? No! [sighs relief] Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? She's on her honeymoon. Honeymoon? With whom? She's on her honeymoon. Honeymoon? With whom? [ Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love] So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on [screams] Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on We were once upon a time in love Hyah! We're accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love Accidentally in love I'm in love I'm in love It's so good to be home! [distant singing] [giggling] Just you and me and... [Donkey sings] Two can be as bad as one... Donkey? Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. [chuckles] And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? Yeah, and feeding the fish! I don't have any fish. You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your... Look at the time. I guess you'd better be going. Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I'd move in with you. You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey. But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. Say no more. You don't have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. Donkey! Yes, roomie? You're bothering me. Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something. He'll be fine. Now, where were we? [giggles] Oh. I think I remember. Donkey! [Fiona yelps] I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm going. What do you want me to tell these other guys? [fanfare] [ theme to Hawaii Five-O] Enough, Reggie. [clears throat] "Dearest Princess Fiona. "You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away "for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage "at which time the King "will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..." uh..."Prince Charming. "Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. "aka Mom and Dad." Mom and Dad? Prince Charming? Royal ball? Can I come? We're not going. [both] What? I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this? [chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too. Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club. Stop it. They're not like that. How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? No! They just want to give you their blessing. Oh, great. Now I need their blessing? If you want to be a part of this family, yes! Who says I want to be part of this family? You did! When you married me! Well, there's some fine print for you! [exasperated sigh] So that's it. You won't come? Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final! Come on! We don't want to hit traffic! [Gingy] Don't worry! We'll take care of everything. [all cheer] Hey, wait for me. Oof! [glass breaks] [sighs] [ Chic: Le Freak] Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw! [Donkey] Are we there yet? [Shrek] No. [Donkey] Are we there yet? [Fiona] Not yet. [Donkey] OK, are we there yet? [Fiona] No. [Donkey] Are we there yet? [Shrek] No! [Donkey] Are we there yet? [Shrek] Yes. Really? No! Are we there yet? [Fiona] No! Are we there yet? [Shrek] We are not! Are we there yet? [Shrek & Fiona] No! Are we there yet? [Shrek mimics] That's not funny. That's really immature. [Shrek mimics] This is why nobody likes ogres. [Shrek mimics] Your loss! [Shrek mimics] I'm gonna just stop talking. Finally! This is taking forever, Shrek. There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. Far, far... [softly] away! All right, all right, I get it. I'm just so darn bored. Well, find a way to entertain yourself. [sighs] [deep sigh] [clicks tongue] [popping] [popping] [exasperated sigh] For five minutes... Could you not be yourself... [shouts]... for five minutes! [popping] [shrieks] Are we there yet? [chuckles] Yes! Oh, finally! [fanfare] [ Lipps, Inc: Funkytown] Wow! It's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on. Hey, good-looking! We'll be back to pick you up later! Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me We are definitely not in the swamp anymore. [whistle] Halt! Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it Hey, everyone, look. Talk about, talk about movin'... Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? You working that hat. [Donkey] Swimming pools! Movie stars! [cheering] [applause] [fanfare] Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. Well, this is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. [fanfare] [fanfare and cheering stop] [gasps] [tweeting] [baby wails] Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? I'll park the car. [chuckles] So... you still think this was a good idea? Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us. [softly] Who on earth are they? [softly] I think that's our little girl. That's not little! That's a really big problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look... [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let's go before they light the torches. They're my parents. Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it. Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be... A disaster! There is no way... You can do this. I really... Really... don't... want... to... be... Here! Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. Well, um... It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from. [chuckles nervously] [gulps] [belches] Excuse me. [Shrek & Fiona laugh] Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona? [both giggle] [Shrek] That's good. I guess not. What do you mean, "not on the list"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What do you mean, "not on the list"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What's happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. I had the hardest time finding this place. No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right. He's with us. He helped rescue me from the dragon. That's me: the noble steed. Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy. [slurps] Um, Shrek? Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm! No, no. Darling. [chuckles nervously] Oh! So, Fiona, tell us about where you live. Well... Shrek owns his own land. Don't you, honey? Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and... [laughing] What? I know you ain't talking about the swamp. An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. [splutters] [chokes] It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it? Indeed. I just started eating. Harold! What's that supposed to mean? Dad. It's great, OK? For his type, yes. My type? I got to go to the bathroom. Dinner is served! Never mind. I can hold it. Bon appetit! Oh, Mexican food! My favorite. Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in. Don't mind if I do, Lillian. I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't eat your own young! Dad! No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower! Shrek, please! I only did that because I love her. Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. You wouldn't understand. You're not her father! It's so nice to have the family together for dinner. Harold! Shrek! Fiona! Fiona! Mom! Harold... Donkey! [glissando] Your fallen tears have called to me So, here comes my sweet remedy I know what every princess needs For her to live life happily... [both gasp] Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You're all grown up. Who are you? Oh, sweet pea! I'm your fairy godmother. I have a fairy godmother? Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. I'm here to make it all better. With just a... Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You'll land a prince with a ton of cash A high-priced dress made by mice no less Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse Confide in your very own furniture friends We'll help you set a new fashion trend I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great The kind of girl a prince would date!

A sporty carriage to ride in style, Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle Banish your blemishes, tooth decay, Cellulite thighs will fade away And oh, what the hey! Have a bichon fris√©! ' Nip and tuck, here and there to land that prince with the perfect hair Lipstick liners, shadows blush To get that prince with the sexy tush Lucky day, hunk buffet You and your prince take a roll in the hay You can spoon on the moon With the prince to the tune Don't be drab, you'll be fab Your prince will have rock-hard abs Cheese souffl√©, Valentine's Day Have some chicken fricassee! Nip and tuck, here and there To land that prince with the perfect hair Stop! [chuckles] Look... Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this. [gasps and mutterings of disapproval] Fine. Be that way. We didn't like you, anyway. [knocking] [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona? [dog barks] Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... Fairy Godmother, furniture... [giggles] I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? Shrek is the one who rescued me. But that can't be right. Oh, great, more relatives! She's just trying to help. Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. What? I don't want to leave. When did you decide this? Shortly after arriving. Look, I'm sorry... No, that's all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear. If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away. Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy... [laughs] So I see. Let's go, Kyle. Very nice, Shrek. What? I told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried to get along with my father. I don't think I was going to get Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it. Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted? Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? You're unbelievable! You're behaving like a... Go on! Say it! Like an ogre! Here's a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not... I am an ogre! [yelps] [roars] And guess what, Princess? That's not about to change. I've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. That's real smooth, Shrek. "I'm an ogre!" [mimics Shrek roaring] [sniffling] I knew this would happen. [Lillian] You should. You started it. I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona's choice. But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you if you don't. I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don't you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... they were in bloom... Our first kiss. It's not the same! I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all wonderful! I'd like to know how it could get any worse! Hello, Harold. [gasps] What happened? Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! [chuckles] I'll just stretch it out here for a while. You better get in. We need to talk. Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. [yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new? You remember my son, Prince Charming? Is that you? My gosh! It's been years. When did you get back? Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert... I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... Mommy can handle this. He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. It wasn't my fault. He didn't get there in time. Stop the car! [crash] Harold. You force me to do something I really don't want to do. [gasps] Where are we? Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May I take your order? My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... I'll have the Medieval Meal. One Medieval Meal and, Harold... Curly fries? No, thank you. Sourdough soft taco, then? No, really, I'm fine. Your order, Fairy Godmother. This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part. [sighs deeply] Indeed not. So, Fiona and Charming will be together. Yes. Believe me, Harold. It's what's best. Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom. What am I supposed to do about it? Use your imagination. [whooshing] [whinnies] Oh... Come on in, Your Majesty. [piano plays, people talk] I like my town With a little drop of poison Nobody knows... [barman belches] [clears throat] Excuse me. Do I know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. Who's the guy? Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. [crowd gasp] Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could I find him? [knock on door] Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre. [ Eels: I Need Some Sleep] [snoring] [chimes] Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. [plays tune] Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. [echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming. [knock on door] Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. Okay... I don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... Look, Your Majesty, I just... Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona. [sighs] Shall we say, : by the old oak? [birds twitter] [Shrek] Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. "Head to the darkest part of the woods..." "Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches." The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to help. I know! I know. I'm sorry, all right? Hey, don't worry about it. I just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy. [purring] [purring] Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? I ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! [hisses] Look! A little cat. Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! It's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. [screaming] Whoa! Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming! Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! Look out, Shrek! Hold still! Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! Did I miss? No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! I'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha! [coughs] [wheezes] [retches] [coughs] [chuckles] Hairball. Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Se√±or. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? S√≠. [screams] Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like I wouldn't change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... "Happiness." "A tear drop away." Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Pi√±ata!!" What is a pi√±ata, anyway? No, Donkey! I need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. I know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a "happy ever after." Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you. Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? Shrek! Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. Let's keep him! Say what? [purrs] Ahh! Listen. He's purring! Oh, so now it's cute. Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! [giggles] Shrek! [barks] [barks] Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine. [sighs] Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. Oh, hello, dear. What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? I haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. Can I help you, Your Majesty? Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. Maybe you should do the same. [both whisper] No, really? [both laugh] [Shrek] Shh... Oh... [hooter blasts] Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell! [Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter] [Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh. Hi. I'm here to see the... The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry. She is not in. Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now! [sighs] Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK? That's OK, buddy. We're from the union. The union? We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. Oh! Oh, right. Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed? Uh... a little. We don't even have dental. They don't even have dental. Okay, we'll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. Know what I'm saying? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Stop it. Of course. Go right in. [voices and grinding machines] [explosion] A drop of desire. [giggles] Naughty! A pinch of passion. [laughs] And just a hint of... lust! [laughs] [Shrek] Excuse me. [gasps] Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name are you doing here? Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question as to why that is? Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. "Lived happily ever after." Oh... [laughs] No ogres! Let's see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don't live happily ever after. All right, look, lady! Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry. Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. Just... go. Come on, guys. [whistles tune] TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses. Well, one of these has got to help. I was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top? No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Shrek, are you off your nut? Donkey, keep watch. Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch. I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be giggling to myself. What do you see? Toad Stool Softener? I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. Elfa Seltzer? Uh-uh. Hex Lax? No! Try "handsome." Sorry. No handsome. Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"? Well, what does it do? It says "Beauty Divine." In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures. Especially us talking ones. [gasps] Donkey! That'll have to do. We've got company. Can we get on with this? Hurry! Nice catch, Donkey! Finally! A good use for your mouth. [ Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love] Come on! You spurn my natural emotions You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt And if I start a commotion I run the risk of losing you and that's worse Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone, ever fallen in love With someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with Fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with I don't care whose fault it is. Just get this place cleaned up! And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate! Mother! Charming. Sweetheart. This isn't a good time, pumpkin. Mama's working. Whoa, what happened here? The ogre, that's what! What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! Oh, put it away, Junior! You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up with something smarter. Pardon. Um... Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? Oh... I do believe we can make this work to our advantage. "Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. "For you and your true love. "If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. "Happiness, comfort and beauty divine." You both will be fine? I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here. It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad can it be? [sneezes] See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. And if you think that I'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. Oh, no, no. I don't think so. If there'll be any animal testing, I'll do it. That's the best friend's job. Now give me that bottle. How do you feel? I don't feel any different. I look any different? You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. Well, here's to us, Fiona. Shrek? You drink that, there's no going back. I know. No more wallowing in the mud? I know. No more itchy butt crack? I know! But you love being an ogre! I know! But I love Fiona more. Shrek, no! Wait! [gurgling] [farts] Got to be... I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion. Maybe it's a dud. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. [thunder rumbles] Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I feel something coming on. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I'm melting! I'm melting! It's just the rain, Donkey. [chuckles] Oh. Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you. [hisses] lt'll be better in the morning. You'll see... The sun'll come out... Tomorrow [yawns] Bet your bottom... Bet my bottom? I'm coming, Elizabeth! Donkey? Are you all right? Hey, boss. Let's shave him. D-Donkey? [groans] [Puss In Boots shrieks] There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? Dad... I've been thinking about what you said. And I'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! That's my girl. It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong. [Lillian] Fiona, please! Let's not be rash, darling. You can't go anywhere right now. [rain patters] [Both] Fiona! Look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Quiet. Look at him. [Shrek groans] Good morning, sleepyhead. [Shrek shouts] [All] Good morning! We love your kitty! [Shrek] Oh... My head... Here, I fetched a pail of water. Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh... A cute button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks? I'm... I'm... Gorgeous! I'll say. I'm Jill. What's your name? Um... Shrek. Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe? You're tense. I want to rub his shoulders. I got it covered. I don't have anything to rub. Get in line. Get in line. Have you seen my donkey? Who are you calling donkey? Donkey? You're a... A stallion, baby! I can whinny. [whinnies] I can count. Look at me, Shrek! I'm trotting! That's some quality potion. What's in that stuff? "Oh, don't take the potion, Mr. Boss, it's very bad." Pah! "Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. "Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders." I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah! What? Se√±or? "To make the effects of this potion permanent, "the drinker must obtain his true love's kiss by midnight." Midnight? Why is it always midnight? Pick me! I'll be your true love! I'll be your true love. I'll be true... enough. Look, ladies, I already have a true love. [all] Oh... And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. And let's face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. Inside you're the same old mean, salty... Easy. ... cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. And you're still the same annoying donkey. Yeah. [sighs] Well... Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. First things first. We need to get you out of those clothes. [all gasp] Ready? Ready! [Donkey screams] Driver, stop! Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again? You poor creature! Is there anything I can do for you? Well, I guess there is one thing. Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers. Not bad. Not bad at all. [both laugh] Father? Is everything all right, Father? Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget. [whinnies] [Puss in Boots, in angry Spanish] [ Butterfly Boocher: Changes] [ Butterfly Boocher: Changes] Oh, yeah Turn and face the strange Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange Ch-Ch-Changes Just gonna have to be a different man Time may change me But I can't trace time Halt! Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. Still don't know what I was looking for And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets Every time I thought I'd got it made It seemed the taste was not so sweet [screams] Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange Shrek? Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Time may change me But I can't trace time Fiona? Hello, handsome. Shrek! Princess! Donkey? Wow! That potion worked on you, too? What potion? Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well... Now, we're sexy! Shrek? [purrs] For you, baby... I could be. Yeah, you wish. Donkey, where is Shrek? He went inside looking for you. Shrek? Fiona! Fiona! You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? Shrek? Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened to your voice? The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you. Fiona? Charming? Do you think so? [laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve. Um... Who are you? Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think? [Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon. [sighs deeply] Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? I just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She's finally found the prince of her dreams. But look at me. Look what I've done for her. It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and you're an ogre. That's something no amount of potion will ever change. But... I love her. If you really love her... you'll let her go. [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] Shrek? Se√±or. What's going on? Where are you going? You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? People just ain't no good I think that's well understood There you go, boys. Just leave the bottle, Doris. Hey. Why the long face? It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. I hate Mondays. I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. Come on. Is he really that good-looking? Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. Oh. He sounds dreamy. You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better. Look, guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of. Everybody wins. Except for you. I don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. Aye. And that's why I have to let her go. Excuse me, is she here? She's, uh... in the back. Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. FYI, not my fault. No, of course it's not, dear. I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre? No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? [both] What? You can't force someone to fall in love! I beg to differ. I do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. Umm... no. What did you say? I can't. I won't do it. Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it? No. Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming's hair before the ball. He's hopeless. He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother. [Donkey] Mother? Um... Mary! A talking horse! The ogre! Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! Stop them! (Announcer) The abs are fab and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout! The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet's curds and whey. Everyone who's anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous! Look! Hansel and Gretel! What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! Oh, aren't they adorable! [screaming] [woman] Here comes Sleeping Beauty! Tired old thing. Who's this? Who's this? Who is this? Oh. It's the one, it's the only... It's the Fairy Godmother! Hello, Far, Far Away! Can I get a whoop whoop? May all your endings be happy and... Well, you know the rest! We'll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages. I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture! I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona. Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left! Tonight on "Knights"... Now here's a good show! We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup. It's time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won't fly. Why you grabbing me? Police brutality! I have to talk to Princess Fiona! We warned you! Ow! Ow! Did someone let the cat out of the bag? You capitalist pig dogs! [shrieks] Catnip! That's not mine. Find Princess Fiona! I'm a donkey! Tell her Shrek... I'm her husband, Shrek! Quick! Rewind it! I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow! [knock on door] Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball? I'm not going. The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. There's just one problem. That's not my husband. I mean, look at him. Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You'd be surprised how much I changed for your mother. Change? He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. But it's the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. Otherwise I'm up all night. Thanks. I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You're supposed to say I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent! You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad. Shrek? Donkey? Too late. Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! Oh... [ Theme from Mission Impossible] Fire in ze hole! [explosion, rumbling] Look out below! Quick! Tell a lie! What should I say? Anything, but quick! Say something crazy like "I'm wearing ladies' underwear!" I am wearing ladies' underwear. Are you? I most certainly am not! It looks like you most certainly am are! I am not! What kind? It's a thong! Oww! They're briefs! Are not. Are too! Are not! Are too! Here we go. Hang tight. [Donkey] Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow! Excuse me? What? Puss! Pardon me, would you mind letting me go? Sorry, boss. Quit messing around! We've got to stop that kiss! I thought you was going to let her go. I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona. Boom! That's what I like to hear. Look who's coming around! It's impossible! We'll never get in. The castle's guarded. There's a moat and everything! Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. What? Do you still know the Muffin Man? Well, sure! He's down on Drury Lane. Why? Because we're gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour. Gingy! Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill! [evil chuckle] [Gingy] It's alive! [rattling] [gasping] [whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can! [screaming] Go, baby, go! There it is, Mongo! To the castle! [Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry! Come on! [all shout] [Donkey] Mongo! Down here! Look at the pony! That's right! Follow the pretty pony! Pretty pony wants to play at the castle! [Mongo] Pretty pony. Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek. [applause, cheering] Shrek, what are you doing? I'm just playing the part, Fiona. Is that glitter on your lips? Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste? Ugh! What is with you? But, Muffin Cake... [piano plays] C Minor, put it in C Minor. Ladies and gentlemen. [applause, cheering] I'd like to dedicate this song to... Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor me with a dance? Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods? [all chant] Dance! Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds? Since when do you dance? Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises. Late at night I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need Hit it! I need a hero All right, big fella! Let's crash this party! Man the catapults! Aim! Fire! Brace yourselves! Ooh! Purty! [groaning] Not the gumdrop button! [enraged howling] Incoming! Ha-ha! All right! Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Go, Mongo! Go! Man the cauldrons! After you, Mongo. That's it! Heave-ho! Watch out! Shrek! More heat, less foam! Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above Out where the lightning Splits the sea I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me Heave! Ho! [Gingy, slow-motion] No...!

[all] Aww... [growling] On guard! He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast. And he's gotta be fresh From the fight I need a hero Stop! [Donkey whinnies] Hey, you! Back away from my wife. Shrek?

You were supposed to give her the potion! Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea. [Charming] Mommy! Mommy? [growls] I told you. Ogres don't live happily ever after. [screams] Woo! Ha! [breathes deeply] [gasping] Oh, Dad! [sobbing] Is he...? Yup. [croaking] He croaked. Harold? Dad? I'd hoped you'd never see me like this. And he gave you a hard time! Donkey! No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now... she already has it. Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing? Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve. You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all. [ribbits] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever? What? Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. You'd do that? For me? Yes. I want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after... with the ogre I married. Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry! [sobbing] [clock chimes] Whoa! No. No, no. Aaah! Ow. Oh, no. [sighs] [laughs] Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me. [giggles] Now, where were we? Oh. I remember. [giggling] [applause] Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having a fiesta?

I hate dinner theater! Me, too. Whoa there, Chauncey! Hark! The brave Prince Charming approacheth. Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay the monster that guards you... ... then take my place as rightful king. What did she say? It's Shrek! Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

Someday you'll be sorry. We already are! Mommy... You're right. I can't let this happen. I can't! I am the rightful King of Far Far Away. And I promise you this, Mother... ... I will restore dignity to my throne. And this time, no one will stand in my way. Good morning. Good morning. Morning breath. I know. Isn't it wonderful? Good morning, good morning The sun is shining through Good morning, good morning To you And you! And you! They grow up so fast. Not fast enough. You'll be filling in for the King and Queen. Several functions require your attendance, sir. Great! Let's get started. Come on, lazybones. Time to get moving! You need to get a pair ofjammies. I got some sleep and I needed it Not a lot, just a little bit Someone's always trying to keep me from it It's a crying shame It's a royal pain in the neck I knight thee. If you're filling in for a king, you should look like one. Can somebody come in and work on Shrek? I will see what I can do. Yeah, wow. Is this really necessary? Quite necessary, Fiona. - I'm Shrek, you twit. - Whatever. This isn't a rehearsal, peoples. Let's see some hustle! Smiles, everyone! Smiles! I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm sorry, but can you just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. Shrek? You look handsome. Come here, you. My butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit. Hey, you! Come here. What's your name? Fiddlesworth, sir. Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen... ... Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek! Ahh! You've got it. A little to the left. That's it! That's good. Oh, yeah! Scratch that thing! You're on it. Shrek! My eye! What are you doing? Fiona! - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Shrimp! My favorite! - That's it! We're leaving! - Calm down. Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre. I'm not cut out for this, Fiona, and I never will be. I think that went well. Donkey! Come on, Shrek! Some people just don't understand boundaries. Just think. A couple more days and we'll be back home... ... in our vermin-filled shack strewn with fungus... ... and filled with the stench of mud and neglect. You had me at "vermin-filled". And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter of little feet on the floor. That's right, the swamp rats will be spawning. Uh, no. What I'm thinking of is a little bigger than a swamp rat. Donkey? No, Shrek. What if, theoretically... ... they were little ogre feet? Honey, let's be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop, and they cry... ... then they cry when they poop and poop when they cry. Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra-cry and they extra-poop. Shrek, don't you ever think about having a family? Right now, you're my family. Well, somebody better be dying. I'm dying. Harold? Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian. Of course, darling. Look, I was gonna go easy on you. Not to hurt your feelings. But I'm only going to get this one chance. Something's wrong, I can feel it. (Six minutes). Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen. But I don't know what. If that means what I think it means. We're in trouble, big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say. I'm not taking any chances. You are just what the doc ordered. I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough. To slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. But for me to rap like a computer. It must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin' and a killin' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack. I'm an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match. With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC. In the back of the Ac'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time. I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts. While I'm practicin' that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic. I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow?. All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin' a rough time period. Here's a maxi pad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody wants the key and the secret. To rap immortality like Œô have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N. W. A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up. Blow up and be in a position. To meet Run‚ÄìD. M. C., induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I'll walk in the church. And burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in. Is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game. 'Til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?. Little gay-lookin' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face. Lookin' boy (Ha-ha!). You're witnessin' a massacre. Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy. "Oy vey, that boy's gay!"‚Äîthat's all they say, lookin' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy. Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?. I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy. I'ma work for everything I have. Never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin' boy!. Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable. Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause‚Äî. I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racin' around the track. Call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Krypton‚Äîno, Asgard, Asgard. So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off, then I'm reloadin'. Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head. A zombie floatin'. But I got your mom deep-throatin'. I'm out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin' in common, poodle. I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm. And pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't. Utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this. Chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoah Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin'. To censor you like that one line. I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now. That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm. Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal. You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad. Singin' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!". Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J. J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?. Innovative and I'm made of rubber. So that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me. And it'll glue to you and. I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience. A feeling like it's levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. "Oh, he's too mainstream.". Well, that's what they do when they get jealous. They confuse it. "It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "‚Äî'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it. "I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use.". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm rippin' any one of these. that versus you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice. Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself 'cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you. I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz. Still "Chunky but Funky". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. And here's what they want from me. They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons?. Make lemonade then!. But if I can't batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake. If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don't be a retard ‚Äî Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God? Homestuck is suffering with the decline of Flash, and as long as it exists on the internet, these problems will be inherent to it. The ideal outcome for this collection is that it keeps Homestuck alive for people who may otherwise have given up on it, so they can continue to support all the official channels going forward. If this project results in even one new fan hopping on-board who otherwise wouldn't have, I would consider that a success. The Unofficial Homestuck Collection is a heavily customised browser, built from the ground up to support Homestuck and its related works. Flashes? We got 'em. The collection runs Flash content natively, providing the most authentic Homestuck experience possible. Don't get it twisted though, because "browser" in this context doesn't mean "online". The Unofficial Homestuck Collection is completely self contained, and never has to connect to the internet once you have it downloaded. We've got complete control over the browser, so you'd better believe we're taking advantage of it. Mid 2000's quality bitcrushed Flash audio? Nah, man. Almost every single flash in Homestuck has been painstakingly reworked with the highest quality music available. You have to hear it to believe it. Want to use themes on every page? Go nuts, I'm not the boss of you. Arrow key navigation? Automatically opening pesterlogs? You got it. Want absolutely none of the above? That's also an option! It's Homestuck, the way you want it. Let me tell you a story about a webcomic called Homestuck. The fourth in a series of ‚ÄúMS Paint Adventures‚Äù authored by Andrew Hussie from 2006 to 2016, it became wildly successful, in part because of its eclectic use of web technology like Adobe Flash and GIF animations. However, with Flash finally being phased out at the end of 2020, Homestuck is in a precarious state. While there have been official attempts to preserve aspects of the original experience by VIZ Media (who have published Homestuck since 2018), the results have been mixed. With extra content scattered around the web in various states of decay, a solution was needed to preserve Homestuck's one-of-a-kind presentation and flair, for both returning readers and those new to the story. Dear students, just a quick reminder that tomorrow (May 4th) we have the first online exercise sessions, aimed at students (including EE students) who cannot follow Thursday's on-campus sessions. We will have one hour to make some exercises on the previous lectures. There are four sessions, which you can find in the list of active Virtual Classroom sessions, you can join whichever suits best. Last week we didn't have these sessions because of King's day. Next week Thursday is a holiday so then we will have the on-campus sessions on Tuesday and no online sessions. After that, we will be able to follow a more regular schedule. Best regards, Why should we actually care about software testing? Because bugs are everywhere! As a person who is probably highly dependent on software technology, you should have encountered a few software bugs in your life. Some of them probably did not affect you that much. For example, maybe your Alarm app on your mobile phone crashed, and you did not wake up in time for a meeting. However, some other bugs might have (negatively) affected your life. Societies all over the world have faced critical issues due to software bugs, from medical devices that do not work properly and harm patients, to electric power plants that completely shut down. And, while these software systems we gave as examples might seem far out from most developers' daily jobs, it is impressively easy to make mistakes even in less critical/complex software systems. To illustrate how hard it is to spot bugs, let's start with a requirement: Requirement: Min-max Implement a program that, given a list of numbers (integers), returns the smallest and the largest numbers in this list. This looks like a very simple program to implement; maybe even an exercise for an Introduction to Programming course. A first implementation in Java could be as follows: No, we can not. The current implementation does not work for all the possible cases. There's a bug in there! (Can you find the bug? Look at the implementation above and try to find it!) Again, this is indeed a trivial bug. Once you have found it, it might indeed look like an unfortunate mistake. But this kind of mistakes can and do happen all the time. Why? The answer is simple: developers deal with highly complex software systems. Software systems that are composed of millions (if not billions) of lines of code. Software that generates tons of data per second. Software that communicates with hundreds (if not thousands) of external systems in an asynchronous and distributed manner. Software that has millions of user requests per hour. It is simply impossible to predict, during development time, everything that can happen. This is why we need to test software. Because the world is complex, bugs do happen. And they can really have a huge impact in our lives. What is the solution? To rigorously and systematically test the software systems we develop. I think vegans is a great way to end a sentence. An example of independent and identically distributed random variables is throwing a bunch of dice multiple times; every throw has the same distribution (identical), and one throw does not affect another (independent). Ok, so I know that everyone here knows about the trolley problem right? Would you kill the one to save the five and blah blah blah. I have a question, why tf would I save the five guys. Hear me out, so you're supposed to be walking near train tracks where six people are working; five on one side and one on the other. A train is going down the path with five people on it and it will kill them unless you pull a lever that will kill the one guy on the other side. Most people chose this option because it's better for one person to die than for five people to die. However, I have one question, how the fuck did NONE of the FIVE guys not see or hear the train. These dumbasses didn't make any effort to fucking move out of the way? Fine, be that way. I wouldn't pull the lever. That one guy was on the correct side and is clearly doing his job right but the other five are being stupid. "B-bUt ThEn FiVe DiE InStEaD Of O-" shut tf up. Then let the five die, at least I get one smart chad instead of five dumb bitches. YOU DON'T PUT AN APOSTROPHE AFTER PLURAL WORDS. DOGS AND DOG'S ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE MORE YOU FUCKERS FORGET HOW AN APOSTROPHE WORKS THE MORE YEARS I LOSE TRYING TO COMPREHEND HOW YOU GOT TO THIS LEVEL OF BRAINROT. Holy shit, it's not hard to understand. The punctuation is there to show a thing's ownership of another thing, not to expressultiple of a thing. That's what the s is for at the end of a word, or maybe it doesn't end with s and is still plural. Either way, you wouldn't be able to tell because you're too busy feeding off of marker ink like the pissbaby preschool vampires you are. I bet you burst into flames when you walk into the science lab without goggles. I bet you can't see your reflection in the tiny-ass bathroom mirror. I bet you shat yourself the first time you coughed and your filthy snot-nose didn't explode with ectoplasm whenever you coughed. Do you levitate when the teacher turns off the lights for movie time? Can you walk onto the playground without being invited over? Do you eat crayons to get stronger? Hello, I noticed you have a profile picture of a very beautiful (but also intelligent looking!) female, and I am under the presumption that this goddess is you? It is quite astonishing to see a female here on Reddit. I am quite popular around here in this subreddit, so if you require and guidance, please, throw me a mention. I will assist you at any hour, day or night. And, before you are mistaken, I do not seek your hand in a romantic way; although, I am not opposed in the event you are interested in me, as many women often are. I am a man of standard, and I do not bow to just any female that comes my way, unlike my peers... So rest assured that I will not be in the way of your gaming and socializing experience. Consider me a Player 2.. a companion, a partner, and perhaps we can enjoy some video games together some time. I see you post memes, and are you good at mini games? I am a mini-game aficionado, so I would be happy to assist you in games. Platonically of course, unless you (like many others) change your mind on that. I look forward to our future together (as friends of course.)
